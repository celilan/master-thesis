abstract = {This paper presents a new framework for intrusion detection in the next-generation Internet of Things. MinMax normalization strategy is used to collect and preprocess data. The Marine Predator algorithm is then used to select relevant features to be used in the learning process. The selected features are then trained with an advanced and state-of-the-art recurrent neural network that includes an attention mechanism. Finally, Shapely values are calculated to determine how much each feature contributes to the final output. The dataset NSL-KDD was used for intensive simulations. The results show the advantages of the proposed system as well as its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. In fact, the proposed solution achieved a rate of more than 94% for both true negative and true position, while the rates of the existing solutions are below 90% for the challenging NSL-KDD datasets.}
