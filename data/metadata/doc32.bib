abstract = {Pairwise preference information, which involves users expressing their preferences by comparing items, plays a crucial role in decision-making and has recently found application in recommendation systems. In this study, we introduce GcPp, a clustering algorithm that leverages pairwise preference data to generate recommendations for user groups. Initially, we construct individual graphs for each user based on their pairwise preferences and utilize a graph convolutional network to predict similarities between all pairs of graphs. These predicted similarity scores form the foundation of our research. We then construct a new graph where users are nodes and the edges are weighted according to the predicted similarities. Finally, we perform clustering on the graphâ€™s nodes (users). By evaluating various metrics, we found that employing a similarity metric based on a convolutional neural network (SimGNN) with our proposed ground truth called Top-K yielded the highest accuracy. The proposed approach is specifically designed for group recommendation systems and holds significant potential for group decision-making problems.
