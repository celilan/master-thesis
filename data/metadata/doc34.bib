    abstract = { Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA) are well-studied computational universes capable of impressive computational variety, but harnessing their potential has been challenging. When combined with Reservoir Computing (RC), harnessing this computation becomes feasible, and furthermore enables energy efficient AI. This study compares ECA reservoirs to topological heterogeneous and more biological plausible counterparts of Partially-Local CA (PLCA) and Homogeneous Homogeneous Random Boolean Networks (HHRBN). Using the 5-bit memory benchmark, Temporal Derrida plots and collapse rate, finding are that more disordered topology does not equate to more disordered computation and moreover the evidence suggest this heterogeneity shrinks the critical range. }
