abstract = {The combination of local renewable energy production, dynamic loads, and multiple energy storage systems with different dynamics requires sophisticated control systems to maximize the energy cost efficiency of the combined energy system. Battery and thermal energy storage systems can be combined to increase the local use of on-site renewable energy, reduce peak power demand, and exploit time-of-use energy pricing. In this paper, we focus on how the augmented random search algorithm and artificial neural networks can be used together to solve an energy cost optimization problem involving the control of a battery energy storage system and a thermal energy storage system at the same time in a smart warehouse. As part of this work, a simulated training environment made using the data from the smart warehouseâ€™s operations. In addition to the energy storage systems, the warehouse energy system has integrated a large roof mounted photovoltaic power plant and an industrial-scale cooling system. The developed solution is able to minimize the energy costs by modulating both energy systems, depending on the situation. Additionally, when it is tested against the state-of-the-art solutions, our developed solution at worst matches performance when the alternative algorithm is allowed to increase training time by a factor of nearly three. On average, our presented solution doubles the performance of the benchmark algorithm with much less computational resource expenditure.}
