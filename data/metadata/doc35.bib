	abstract = {Network bursts or synchronized burst events are a typical activity seen in most in vitro neural networks. Network bursts arise early in development and as networks mature, activity becomes dominated by bursts propagating across the entirety of the network. The reason for this developmental plateau in vitro is unknown, but to bypass it would confer a significant advantage in the use of in vitro networks for computation. As most neurons in a network participate in network bursts, burst onset supersedes any ongoing activity thereby placing a limit on short term computations equal to the recovery period between bursts. By assessing 521 multielectrode array recordings from day 4-39 in vitro we find that network bursts influence the connectivity, but this change is only weakly associated with the origin of the network bursts. The impacts of bursts on functional integration and segregation in neural networks are discussed along with approaches to mitigate the development and propagation of network bursts in vitro. Additionally, we hypothesize that burst initiation zones or pacemakers are viable targets for stimulation for computation in the context of control and reservoir computing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
