abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has posed an unprecedented threat to the global public health system, primarily infecting the airway epithelial cells in the respiratory tract. Chest X-ray (CXR) is widely available, faster, and less expensive therefore it is preferred to monitor the lungs for COVID-19 diagnosis over other techniques such as molecular test, antigen test, antibody test, and chest computed tomography (CT). As the pandemic continues to reveal the limitations of our current ecosystems, researchers are coming together to share their knowledge and experience in order to develop new systems to tackle it. In this work, an end-to-end IoT infrastructure is designed and built to diagnose patients remotely in the case of a pandemic, limiting COVID-19 dissemination while also improving measurement science. The proposed framework comprises six steps. In the last step, a model is designed to interpret CXR images and intelligently measure the severity of COVID-19 lung infections using a novel deep neural network (DNN). The proposed DNN employs multi-scale sampling filters to extract reliable and noise-invariant features from a variety of image patches. Experiments are conducted on five publicly available databases, including COVIDx, COVID-19 Radiography, COVID-XRay-5K, COVID-19-CXR, and COVIDchestxray, with classification accuracies of 96.01%, 99.62%, 99.22%, 98.83%, and 100%, and testing times of 0.541, 0.692, 1.28, 0.461, and 0.202Â s, respectively. The obtained results show that the proposed model surpasses fourteen baseline techniques. As a result, the newly developed model could be utilized to evaluate treatment efficacy, particularly in remote locations.}
