Introduction: Understanding Roots and Betweenness
Deﬁning Safety of Journalists as a Sub-ﬁeld of Research.
Reading between the Lines
Introduction
The topic of the safety of journalists has emerged as an increasingly important one in public
discourse in tandem with the advancement of the study of journalists’ safety over the last few
years. As more attention is given to the fact that a journalist is killed every seventh day for
work-related reasons, the awareness of the safety of journalists as one of the most daunting
challenges for press freedom and democracy around the world has grown. The Nobel peace
prize award of 2021 to brave journalists Maria Ressa and Dmitiri Muratov also drew inter-
national public opinion’s attention to how the safety of journalists can serve as a pointer
towards democratic development and media freedom in general.
In the more than ten years since the UN Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists was
launched in 2012, the topic of the safety of journalists has emerged signiﬁcantly in academic
and public spheres. In 2014 UNESCO developed a research agenda in line with the Plan of
Action and promoted it through a call for research cooperation with academic scholars to
inspire new research in an area that previously had received little attention. The increase in
publications on journalism safety and the issue of impunity over the last decade is manifest.
However, can we talk about the appearance of a new academic ﬁeld?
Pierre Bourdieu’s ﬁeld theory would see an academic ﬁeld as a space characterized by a dis-
tinct set of rules, values, and norms that shape the actions and decisions of individuals within it
(Bourdieu and Johnson 1993). According to such an approach, ﬁelds are separated from one
another by their own speciﬁc forms of economic, cultural, and social capital, and habitus (dispo-
sitions, ways of thinking, and acting), which deﬁnes the boundaries of each ﬁeld. Using Bour-
dieu’s approach, the research on the safety of journalists would probably rather be a sub-
ﬁeld: distinct areas of specialization within a larger ﬁeld that has their own forms of capital
and habitus (Di Salvo 2022; Garnham and Williams 1980; Hesmondhalgh 2006; Prior 2013).
A reason for considering “Safety of Journalists” as a ﬁeld on its own premises, is the fact that
the UN, UNESCO, University Centres, and Research Groups have jointly worked to increase the
amount and quality of research into safety issues for journalists. One example is the research
agenda for safety of journalists developed by UNESCO in cooperation with researchers. We con-
sequently ﬁnd the topic of safety of journalists to be a remarkably interesting case to investigate
to better understand how a sub-ﬁeld might emerge and develop, and how roots are taken.
Our Question Here would be If the Safety of Journalists is to be
Considered an Academic Field – Where does It Find Its Roots?
To answer this question, we will approach the eleven selected articles of this Special Issue and
map their origins with the help of computational methods, in an attempt to unlock where their
ﬁnds their “roots” in terms of methods used, theoretical frameworks and citation networks,

 which with the help of centrality metrics enable us to say something about the article’s assumed
importance in its network and unpack how the networks relate to each other as topical clusters.
Building on these exercises, we will continue the discussion about the Safety of Journalists as an
academic subﬁeld and discover how knowledge is shared and developed within and among
clusters. Who stands out as important mediators of information in this emerging ﬁeld? And
what characterizes the geographies of the various researchers and research topics?
More than “Just” Ten1 Articles?
The ten articles of this Special Issue were collected from some of the best paper presentations
at the 7th Annual International Conference on the Safety of Journalists at OsloMet University, as
well as through an additional call for papers. To better understand the selected articles, we ﬁrst
systematized the methods used in each of them. We found that all articles utilized in-depth or
semi-structured interviews in some form as their main data collection method. The articles’
authors argue that interviews have the ability to provide a thorough understanding of partici-
pants’ experiences, perceptions, attitudes, and motivations.
Some authors employed mixed methods, combining interviews with surveys (two articles)
and document analysis (three articles), to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of
their research question. According to these authors, this approach allowed them to triangulate
data and enhance the validity and reliability of their results. There are clearly many similarities
between the investigations represented here although the topics and locations of the studies
are quite diverse.
Reading the 11 articles, we realized that the articles speak to each other in terms of theoretical
frameworks and how theoretical perspectives are reﬂected in the methodologies developed for
each investigation. “Resilience” is the most used theoretical framework. It is employed by authors
here to formulate research questions, develop methods, in addition to interpreting and explain-
ing ﬁndings. In general, resilience is seen as the capacity to bounce back from adversity and
maintain functioning in challenging conditions. In the context of journalism, resilience is
being used to refer to the ability of journalists to continue carrying out their work safely in
the face of threats, or to “bounce back” after a critical event. Typically, the authors represented
here also include other theoretical perspectives to understand the safety issues, for example
resistance. This perspective focuses on the means by which journalists withstand threats and per-
severe. Post-traumatic growth is another perspective used to examine how journalists can experi-
ence positive outcomes after exposure to traumatic events, such as increased self-awareness and
personal strength. Emotional labour, meanwhile, highlights the emotional toll that journalism
can take on journalists, including feelings of stress, anxiety, and burnout. The postcolonial fem-
inist approach considers the impact of colonialism and patriarchal structures on the experiences
of journalists, particularly those from marginalized communities. Mediated social capital encom-
passes the role that social networks and relationships play in promoting journalist safety. Discur-
sive structural inequalities highlight the ways in which dominant narratives and power structures
shape the experiences of journalists and impact their safety. Routine activity theory examines
how individuals’ characteristics and routines, contact with motivated oﬀenders, and lack of guar-
dianship dispose them to victimization. Media capture considers the ways in which media organ-
izations and industries can be inﬂuenced by political and economic interests, which can lead to
biased reporting and threats to journalist safety. The social-ecological perspective explores the
interplay between the social and natural environments in shaping journalist safety. Boundary
work is used to analyse the evolution of journalism and its institutions over time. As digital tech-
nology and cultural and political changes raise questions about the deﬁnition and purpose of
journalism, boundary work helps to understand the ongoing development of the ﬁeld.

EDITORIAL
 As guest editors of the special issue, we ﬁnd all these perspectives and lenses help the
authors gain new insights and build knowledge about the safety of journalists. At the same
time, we see that these perspectives are interconnected and belong to similar traditions
related to each other. This kinship is one of the reasons why we want to know more and under-
stand better where the emergent research ﬁeld of safety of journalism is coming from.
Building a Citation Network
At the ﬁrst level of analysis, we reviewed the 11 articles and their references, which in total
added up to 277. We then went on to a second level of analysis, where we developed a citation
network to be able to say something more about where the eleven articles ﬁnd their theoreti-
cal and methodological roots. A citation network is a graph that represents the relationships
between published works based on citations. It is a directed graph with works as nodes and
citations as edges. This network is used in bibliometrics and scientometrics to gain insight
into the structure of scientiﬁc literature and knowledge diﬀusion. By analysing citation net-
works, researchers can study various aspects of the scientiﬁc landscape, such as the
inﬂuence of works, the popularity of topics, the evolution of subject areas, and the emergence
of new subﬁelds. They can also assess the inﬂuence of researchers, institutions, journals,
funding agencies, and other stakeholders. In summary, citation networks are useful for study-
ing the relationships between published works and their inﬂuence on science.
In our analysis of the “safety of journalists” studies, we sought to uncover the roots of this
emerging ﬁeld. Our approach involved tracing the citations of the 11 articles in the special
issue. We started by analysing the citations of these 11 articles and found approximately
270 relevant papers. By taking advantage of a “snowballing” algorithm combined with a bib-
liography API (Crossref n.d.; Pallath n.d.; Pallath and Zhang 2022), we then expanded our
search by following the citations in these papers for two extra level, resulting in the collection
of information on over 44,000 published works. We collected data such as author details,
aﬃliations, article titles, journal names, and publication years to gain a deeper understanding
of who, what, where, and when have had an impact on the development of the ﬁeld over time.
The goal of this analysis was to shed light on the key players, works, and historical events that
have shaped the “safety of journalists” studies.
Our analysis yielded a number of intriguing ﬁndings. We identiﬁed clusters of literature,
using the Louvain algorithm (Blondel et al. 2008), that had a substantial impact on the articles
of the special issue and observed the ﬂow of citations and knowledge between these clusters.
Additionally, several articles emerged as signiﬁcant “bridges,” connecting the clusters and
facilitating the transfer of knowledge. These insights allow us to gain a better understanding
of the disciplines and ﬁelds that are shaping the emergence of “safety of journalists” studies.
The ﬁndings also highlight the importance of interdisciplinary exchange in shaping this ﬁeld.
Lastly, we aim to make possible a further examination of the speciﬁc articles that serve as facil-
itators in bridging knowledge between diﬀerent disciplines and clusters of articles.
Three clusters stand out in terms of the number of articles and citations.
First, the cluster “Cyberbullying and Adolescent Victimization” focuses on the examination of
diﬀerent forms of bullying, victimization, and its impact on the mental and emotional health of
adolescents. The most frequent words and bi-grams include “sexual harassment,” “mental
health,” “fear crime,” and “routine activities,” among others, pointing to a broader concern
for the eﬀects of victimization on individuals, particularly school-aged youth. The trigrams
reinforce this emphasis by highlighting terms such as “high school students,” “middle
school students,” “among college students,” and “among African American,” indicating a par-
ticular interest in the study of bullying among diﬀerent demographics of young people.

827
 Additionally, terms such as “General theory of crime,” “social learning theory,” and “structural
equation modelling” suggest a focus on understanding the underlying theories and modeling
approaches used to study these topics.
The second cluster can be summarized as “Media and Political Communication” with a focus on
the impact of news media, social media, and other forms of communication on public opinion,
political participation, and human rights. It is of course no surprise that a cluster of media and
communication related articles is by far the largest of the clusters. The cluster includes studies
examining the eﬀects of media on attitudes, job satisfaction, and social support, as well as the
role of media in shaping political communication, public sphere, and social movements. The
research also investigates the impact of media coverage on social and political issues such as
sexual harassment, foreign policy, and elections. The analysis includes both content analysis
and comparative studies, and the use of various methodologies such as structural equation mod-
eling, critical discourse analysis, and interpretive phenomenological analysis.
The third cluster appears to focus on the theme of “Mental Health”. The bi-grams and tri-
grams are related to topics such as posttraumatic stress disorder, stress disorder, health
care, asylum seekers, systematic reviews, social support, labor market, mental disorders,
health literacy, quality of life, political violence, primary care, psychological distress, qualitative
research, risk factors, health status, mental health services, and more. The trigrams, speciﬁcally,
delve into topics such as posttraumatic stress disorder among asylum seekers and refugees,
mental health services for displaced persons, symptoms of stress disorder and depression,
mental health problems among Syrian refugees, and randomized controlled trials for treating
posttraumatic stress. Overall, this cluster highlights the importance of addressing mental
health concerns in various populations and the role of various factors such as access to
health care, social support, and political violence in aﬀecting mental health.
In addition to the three dominant clusters, we identiﬁed a further six subclusters of articles.
These subclusters have been given descriptive titles and are summarized below to provide an
idea of the content contained within each. As will be clear from the descriptions below, some
of the clusters are heavily inﬂuenced by the geographies of the studies selected for the special
issue.
Cluster 4: International Law and Human Rights. This cluster of sources revolves around topics
regarding global legislation, human privileges, and legality in armed conﬂicts. It features col-
locations of two or three words and references to journals, reports, and communiques, as well
as terms such as “combating lawlessness,” “humanitarian law,” “minimum humanitarian stan-
dards,” “legal framework,” and “war on terror.
Cluster 5: Suicide Prevention. The focus of this cluster is suicide risk assessment and avoid-
ance. Main areas of concern are suicide risk, suicide prevention, risk factors, suicidal behavior,
suicide attempts, systematic review, and suicidal ideation. Cluster also underscores the signiﬁ-
cance of mental health, personality disorder, and primary care in suicide prevention. Studies
on suicide risk and prevention are typically conducted in the US and emphasize the require-
ment for public health promotion and risk assessment. Cluster mentions randomized con-
trolled trials and cohort studies in understanding suicide risk factors, especially in men.
Dialectical behavior therapy, health behavior change, and suicide prevention programs are
highlighted as important interventions. Cluster discusses the prevalence of suicide risk
factors, depression and primary care relationship, interpersonal and psychological theories
of suicide, and the role of deliberate self-harm in suicide prevention. Systematic reviews of
adolescent suicidal behavior are also emphasized as necessary.
Cluster 6: Turkish Cities and Globalization. This cluster of papers seems to be examining the
theme of urban renewal and political struggles in the context of Turkish cities and globaliza-
tion. The papers delve into the various aspects of urban transformation, citizenship,
828
EDITORIAL
 environmentalism, and politics of space in an urban context, focusing on the struggles of the
poor, refugees, and social movements. Cluster 7: Childcare Policies in Post-Communist Europe.
This cluster focuses on analysing childcare policies in post-communist Central European
countries, particularly their impact on gender equality and the role of women in society.
The papers examine the historical background and current state of welfare policies in countries
such as Poland, Hungary, and Germany and how they have shifted towards a more liberal and
business-oriented approach.
Cluster 8: Family Policies and Gender Relations in Post-Communist Europe. The papers in this
cluster examine family policies and childcare arrangements in post-communist Central Euro-
pean countries and their impact on gender relations and work-life balance. The articles
seem to be utilizing qualitative and comparative methods to gauge the generosity of policies
and evaluate changes in care services.
Cluster 9: Technology and Mental Health. The articles in this cluster examine the intersection
of technology, mental health, and resilience. Topics explored include secondary traumatic
stress among police oﬃcers, resilience training, randomized controlled trials, and the impact
of virtual reality on mental health. The ﬁndings suggest the signiﬁcance of peer support, posi-
tive psychological capital, and judicious design in technology aimed at promoting emotional
well-being and resilience. Based on the articles of this special issue, the emergent ﬁeld of
“Safety of Journalists” appears to be a multidisciplinary ﬁeld that involves the study of numer-
ous issues related to journalists and the media. The most inﬂuential clusters of papers focus on
three main themes: Media and Political Communication; Mental Health and Cyberbullying and
Adolescent Victimization. These themes highlight the importance of addressing certain chal-
lenges that journalists face as well as the impact that media can have on society, including
mental health concerns, bullying and victimization, and political communication. The
studies also suggest that there is a focus on understanding the underlying theories and
methods used to study these topics (Figure 1).

 Betweenness - What makes Knowledge Flow between Clusters?
Once we successfully built a Citation Network, we had the opportunity to extract, for each
article, centrality metrics describing its importance in the network. Two of the most used
metrics in the ﬁeld are “degree”, reﬂecting how many connections each nodes holds, and
“betweenness”, representing the importance of a node in connecting the network together
(Barrat et al. 2004; Borassi and Natale 2016; Jia et al. 2012). Of particular interest for our analysis
is the “betweenness” since it holds a distinct connotation in comparison to other centrality
metrics. Rather than merely reﬂecting the importance of a node in the network, betweenness
characterizes a node’s signiﬁcance as a mediator of information or citation ﬂow between sep-
arate clusters or communities of articles.
This is quantiﬁed by counting the frequency with which the node appears in the shortest
paths linking distinct groups of nodes. Nodes exhibiting a high betweenness score serve as
critical conduits, allowing for the exchange of information between otherwise disparate com-
munities (Barrat et al. 2004; Leydesdorﬀ2007).
The analysis of betweenness in a citation network can provide a nuanced understanding of
the network’s structure and dynamics, illuminating the relationships between disparate com-
munities and the intermediating role of speciﬁc articles.
While centrality gauges a node’s overall prominence, reﬂecting its many connections
and the frequency of its citation by other nodes, betweenness is a metric which
assesses a node’s function as a bridge or connector between disparate communities
of articles.
In our analysis, we elected to concentrate on betweenness rather than centrality because
we wanted to understand the function of particular references in bridging the ﬂow of infor-
mation or citations between diﬀerent research areas. By analysing betweenness, we sought
to discern the nodes which played a crucial role in linking diﬀerent parts of the network
and fostering the exchange of knowledge between these disparate communities.
Top Articles on the Betweenness-list
We found “Comparing Media Systems” to be the most important study in terms of between-
ness-score (Hallin and Mancini 2004). This comes as no surprise, given the signiﬁcant impact
the book has had on the ﬁeld of media and communication studies. Its contributions to
research on media systems, media policy, and comparative media analysis are evident in
the frequency with which it is referenced in these areas. Furthermore, the book’s theoretical
framework has had a profound impact on shaping research in the ﬁeld and has facilitated a
greater understanding of the complex relationship between media, politics, and society
across diﬀerent countries. It is worth noting that the impact of “Comparing Media Systems”
extends beyond media and communication studies. The ﬁndings of this investigation shows
that the book has also played a pivotal role in disseminating theories and knowledge from
media studies to other disciplines.
The book “Comparing Media Systems” belongs to the largest cluster of references which we
named “Media and Political Communication” above. Interestingly, the articles and books in the
Media and Political Communication cluster with the highest betweenness-score must be
divided into at least four diﬀerent groups. Three of the most important references (in terms
of betweenness-score), are more general Media Analysis and Media Theory type of articles
and books such as “Comparing Media Systems”, “An Emotional Turn in Journalism Studies?”
and “The role of self-reports in the study of news production” (Hallin and Mancini 2004;
Ryfe 2020; Wahl-Jorgensen 2020). However, a topically narrower group of references seems
to be playing an even more important role in the ﬂow of knowledge between cluster in this
830
EDITORIAL
 system of references. This group includes titles such as “Not Funny? The Eﬀects of Factual
Versus Sarcastic Journalistic Responses to Uncivil User Comments” (Ziegele and Jost 2020),
“Engagement Moderation: What Journalists Should Say to Improve Online Discussions”
(Masullo, Riedl, and Huang 2022), “Online Harassment and Its Implications for the Journal-
ist–Audience Relationship” (Lewis, Zamith, and Coddington 2020), Mob Censorship: Online
Harassment of US Journalists in Times of Digital Hate and Populism (Waisbord 2020) and
“Roots of Incivility: How Personality, Media Use, and Online Experiences Shape Uncivil Partici-
pation” (Frischlich et al. 2021). Keywords are journalism, incivility, and online harassment. It is
not diﬃcult to understand why these two groups of references belong to the Media and Pol-
itical Communication cluster. Perhaps more surprisingly, an article from Statistics examining
how well certain criteria work when evaluating how well statistical models ﬁt observed
data, is found to be among the top articles when it comes to betweenness-score in this
cluster (Hu and Bentler 1999). The fact that this article is so much cited indicates the impor-
tance of statistical methods for the development of the Media and Political Communication
cluster. The inclusion of “Using thematic analysis in psychology in this cluster, despite its
apparent divergence from the other articles, highlights the signiﬁcance of thematic analysis
as a methodology that transcends disciplinary boundaries, and underscores its potential use-
fulness in both psychological and media and communication studies research (Braun and
Clarke 2006).
The clustering and betweenness score analysis indicate that many general articles on media
and communication studies are being cited in other ﬁelds and disciplines, suggesting a ﬂow of
knowledge beyond the Media and Political Communication cluster. However, it is noteworthy
that statistics and thematic analysis play a crucial role in this cluster. The emphasis on statistics
and thematic analysis suggests the importance of both quantitative and qualitative
approaches in media and communication research, and the need for interdisciplinary collab-
orations to better understand the complex relationship between media, politics, and society.
We also found a few references with hight betweenness-score in the other clusters. The
second most important references (in terms of betweenness-score) in the whole reference
network, is a proposal of a “social-ecological framework of theory, assessment, and prevention
of suicide” (Cramer and Kapusta 2017). The article provides a comprehensive and integrated
framework for understanding and addressing suicide risk that has been widely cited and
used in research and practice, also among researchers of journalism. In this citation
network, the article is part of the cluster we have earlier named “Cluster 5: Suicide Prevention”
with suicide risk, suicide prevention, risk factors, suicidal behavior, suicide attempts, systematic
review, and suicidal ideation as principal areas of concern. The social-ecological framework for
understanding suicide risk takes a comprehensive and integrated approach, recognizing that
suicide prevention eﬀorts should go beyond individual-level risk factors to also address com-
munity and societal factors that contribute to suicide risk.
The last article we will mention here, calls for an integrated, multi-system approach to
address the unique needs of refugee women (Hawkins et al. 2021). It highlights the need
for comprehensive synthesis regarding how individual, interpersonal, community, and organ-
izational factors interact to inﬂuence the health of refugee women. This article plays a vital role
in building knowledge in cluster 3 “Mental Health”.
Our analysis found that articles on suicide prevention and refugee women’s mental health
have high betweenness-score and play important roles in building knowledge in their respect-
ive clusters. Such articles emphasize the need for a comprehensive and integrated approach
that addresses individual, interpersonal, community, and societal factors in for example pre-
venting suicide and improving mental health outcomes for refugee women.
JOURNALISM STUDIES

 Geographies of Researchers & Research Topics
In this ﬁgure, we have plotted the results for the countries mentioned either in author
aﬃliations or in titles. We are particularly interested in the countries represented by the
dark red circles. This is the group of countries deemed by Reporters Without Borders to be
in a very serious (dark red) condition when it comes to safety of journalists (Methodology
Used for Compiling the World Press Freedom Index | RSF n.d.).
In this study, we have utilized the safety index of Reporters Without Borders to rank
countries according to the safety of journalists. Along with that, we have estimated the
number of references that deal with issues related to speciﬁc countries by counting references
that contain the country’s name in the title. Lastly, we have estimated the number of published
authors from diﬀerent countries based on the university aﬃliations mentioned in the author
aﬃliation ﬁelds of the references.
Reporters Without Borders has been monitoring the safety of journalists globally since
2002, providing a safety index that ranks countries according to the safety and protection pro-
vided to journalists (Index | RSF n.d.). The safety index considers a range of factors such as vio-
lence against journalists, legal restrictions, and censorship, among others. This safety index
serves as a useful tool to understand the safety of journalists in diﬀerent countries.
Our analysis has revealed some noteworthy patterns that can be utilized to inform discus-
sions on the safety of journalists. Our ﬁndings indicate that countries with a low ranking in the
safety index of Reporters Without Borders have fewer published authors and references
dealing with issues related to them. On the other hand, many countries that rank high in
the safety index have a higher number of published authors and references. For instance,
countries such as Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark, which rank high in the safety
index, have a relatively larger number of published authors and references dealing with
832
EDITORIAL
 issues related to them. In contrast, countries like Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iraq, which rank
low in the safety index, have fewer published authors and references.
As we see, many of these countries are concentrated in the bottom left quadrant of the
ﬁgure. Amongst the countries scoring low on the RSF safety index, China and Mexico stand
out by the number of titles referring speciﬁcally to China or Mexico and the number of
authors aﬃliated to Chinese or Mexican universities. We believe this is an indication of the rela-
tive strength of the university system and research in general in these two countries. Afghani-
stan, meanwhile, stands out as a country that have received signiﬁcant interest from
researchers but with very few local authors cited in the network. Palestine, Vietnam, and
Morocco are examples of countries that seem to have been little researched while at the
same time very seldom are mentioned in the aﬃliations of the authors.
This ﬁnding is signiﬁcant as it highlights the pressing need for increased attention to the
safety of journalists and the protection of freedom of expression in countries where journalists
face signiﬁcant challenges. However, the study has some limitations. Firstly, the safety index of
Reporters Without Borders is not a comprehensive measure of the safety of journalists, and it
does not account for all factors that can impact the safety of journalists. Secondly, our esti-
mation of the number of published authors and references is based on a simpliﬁed approach,
which may not accurately reﬂect the true number of authors or references.
It is important to note that a large number of countries ranked by Reporters Without
Borders for the safety of journalists are not included in the graph presented in this study.
This is primarily because the graph is based on references that contain a country’s name in
the title and authors’ aﬃliations that mention the country. As a result, countries that are
not mentioned in the titles or do not have any author aﬃliations related to the country are
not represented in the graph.
This limitation is particularly concerning for some of the most dangerous countries for jour-
nalists since they may not have enough published authors or references that meet the criteria
for inclusion in the graph. The top 18 country ranked by safety score which are not represented
in the graph above are reported in the table below.

It is worth noting that the exclusion of a large number of countries from then graph is a
reﬂection of the fact that the citation network was built upon a narrow group of articles
dealing with speciﬁc topics and geographies. These topics and geographies often did not
require the inclusion of references from the excluded countries. Consequently, the exclusion
JOURNALISM STUDIES
833
 of these countries may not necessarily indicate a lack of published authors or references
dealing with issues related to them. Rather, it may be a result of the speciﬁc focus of the articles
included in the citation network. It is important to consider this context when interpreting the
ﬁndings presented in this study and to avoid generalizing the results to countries that we
excluded from the graph. It is also worth noting that while the country Syria has no mentions
in the titles, a number of articles in the network deals with issues related to “Syrian Refugees.”
Knowledge Transfer?
While this exploratory study has limitations, it provides insights into the relationship between
the safety of journalists in individual countries and the number of aﬃliated authors and refer-
ences dealing with that country. Our analysis indicates that there is a linear relationship
between aﬃliations and the number of articles, as seen on a log to log scale. However, the
line for relatively safe countries, those with a score below 60, appears to run parallel to but
signiﬁcantly below the line for more unsafe countries, those with a score above 59.
The ﬁndings suggest that studies focused on unsafe countries are more likely to be con-
ducted by scholars based at universities in relatively safe countries, rather than the other
way around. It indicates that much research about unsafe environments for journalists build
on theories and methodologies developed in relatively safe localities and found useful for
studies of journalists in those localities. While this may seem like an obvious observation,

 and gaps in knowledge production. This understanding can help to inform eﬀorts to improve
the quality and relevance of research, as well as to ensure that the perspectives and experi-
ences of scholars from diverse locations are considered. Overall, the study highlights the
importance of considering the geographic and institutional factors that shape knowledge pro-
duction in the ﬁeld of journalism and related areas. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive
and robust research community that is better equipped to address the complex challenges
facing journalists and freedom of expression globally.
We believe this to be particularly important in relation to the topics and geographies
coming out of this study as this universe of references draw extensively on studies dealing
with Mental Health and Cyberbullying and Adolescent Victimization. We need to ask to what
extent are theories and ﬁndings related to mental health issues stemming from studies in rela-
tively safe locations such as the US or Northers Europe useful when trying to understand safety
related issues in Afghanistan, Syria, Nicaragua or Iraq?
Koch and Weingart suggest that the idea of knowledge transfer is a delusion because it
assumes that knowledge is a tangible and transferable commodity that can be easily trans-
mitted from one location to another (Koch and Weingart 2016). According to their perspective,
this assumption overlooks the complex social, cultural, and institutional factors that shape the
production and dissemination of knowledge in diﬀerent contexts.
Instead, we propose that researchers of the safety of journalists should focus on the idea of
knowledge co-construction, which recognizes that knowledge is a dynamic and socially con-
structed process that involves the interaction and collaboration of diverse actors across
diﬀerent locations and contexts. This perspective highlights the importance of recognizing
and valuing the diverse perspectives, experiences, and knowledge systems that shape
research and innovation in diﬀerent ﬁelds.
Caveat
It is vital to note that the selection of ﬁrst-level articles in a citation network analysis can sig-
niﬁcantly aﬀect the results. In the present study, the ﬁrst articles were those published in this
particular special issue. A diﬀerent set of articles would have resulted in a diﬀerent citation
network. For a more comprehensive understanding of the emerging subﬁeld of journalist
safety, a broader selection of articles should be considered in future projects. However, the
present experiment provides a way to study the development of a ﬁeld or subﬁeld and to
analyse its formation at an early stage. In this way, steps can be taken to ensure a diverse rep-
resentation of topics, geographies, theories, and methodologies in the ﬁeld, thus promoting
inclusiveness and progress.
We recognize that the articles in this special issue may not be fully representative of the
sub-ﬁeld of safety of journalists. Other relevant articles exist that address important topics
and are not included here. Additionally, other scholars employ diﬀering methodologies and
theories from those represented in this issue.
Consequently, we are not claiming that the citation network presented is fully represen-
tative of the sub-ﬁeld. However, this approach serves as a valuable tool for comprehending
the theoretical and methodological foundations and historical origins of this special issue.
Despite its experimental nature, we contend that this approach has the potential to
provide insight into how ﬁelds emerge, and research develops. If nothing else, this
method has allowed us to introduce the articles of this special issue in a productive and
informative manner.
Little has so far been written about the community of scholars studying and contributing to
the increased knowledge base of the safety of journalists. Approaching the growing line of
JOURNALISM STUDIES
835
 academics and critical practitioners interested in the topic and their work as an emerging new
academic ﬁeld, allows us as this article has illustrated, to consider both its prospects and chal-
lenges in more thorough and analytical way.

SUMMARY
Conditioned place avoidance assays are broadly used in mammals to study
different cognitive aspects of operant learning. Here, we introduce a series of
experimental designs for training juvenile zebraﬁsh in short-term and long-
term conditioned place avoidance assays. Our goal is to promote standardization
of animal handling procedures and setup conditions to improve animal welfare
and reproducibility while studying operant learning behaviors in juvenile zebra-
ﬁsh.
For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to
Palumbo et al. (2020).
BEFORE YOU BEGIN
Before describing all the steps of our behavioral experiments in detail we want to emphasize the
importance of proper and reproducible zebraﬁsh husbandry to ensure reproducibility of most
behavioral assays, including our conditioned place avoidance learning assay (Palumbo et al.,
2020) described in the following section.
Fish maintenance and husbandry
Note: The animal facilities and maintenance of the zebraﬁsh, Danio rerio, were approved by
the Norwegian Food Safety Authority.
1. Keep ﬁsh in 3.5-liter tanks in a Techniplast Zebtech Multilinking system at constant conditions:
a. Temperature=28C
b. pH=7
c. Water conductivity=600 mSiemens
d. Dark/light cycle=14:10 h light/dark cycle
e. Maximum animals per tank= 35; 10 animals per liter of water at adult stage
f.
Diet: dry food two times a day (SDS 100–400, dependent of age) and, after the 5th day of
development, also Artemia nauplii once a day (ZM Brine Shrimp Cysts Premium 250 Grade,
ZM Systems). We notice an increase in animal health and growth since we started feeding
them Artemia nauplii as soon as 5 days post fertilization.
Note: Variations from the above-mentioned parameters in ﬁsh husbandry will affect animal
welfare and stress level, and it might affect the outcome of the experiment.

 Note: We recommend standardizing the breeding procedures to minimize experimental vari-
ability. We have optimized the following procedure.
2. Place animals for breeding before the evening feeding in subgroups of 5 to 10 ﬁsh.
3. On the following day, collect the eggs in a petri dish containing egg water, a solution of 0.1%
methylene blue in artiﬁcial ﬁsh water (AFW, 0.2 g/L instant ocean salt in reverse osmosis water
(RO)), and incubate at 28.5C.
4. Clean the Petri dish and exchange the egg water on a daily basis.
5. At the 5th day post fertilization screen the animals for positive expression of the transgenic ﬂuo-
rescent protein of interest.
6. Transfer the larvae zebraﬁsh to the zebraﬁsh facility into 0.7 L nursery nets installed in 3,5 L tanks
(see key resources table) until 3–4 weeks post fertilization. Pay attention to keep the number of
animal larvae around 100 per tank.
7. Keep the water ﬂow outside of the nursery net for the ﬁrst 7–10 days (from day 5 until day 15 post
fertilization). This will limit mechanical stress on the young animals, while ensuring a high rate of
water turnover surrounding the nursery nets.
Note: Putting the animal into nursery nets will provide them with a high exchange of fresh wa-
ter while keeping them in a conﬁned space and protected by the mechanical stress of the wa-
ter ﬂow.
Fish handling
Timing: 20 min
Stress and anxiety can severely impact animal behavior to a point of disrupting its learning capa-
bility. Therefore, caution in handling the animals is essential both before and during behavioral
testing. We therefore optimized a series of good practices to ensure we minimize animal stress
caused by experimenter handling. We recommend observing animal behavior during and after
any procedure is performed.
8.
Collect the zebraﬁsh, once the desired age is reached, from the zebraﬁsh facility in the same
morning of the planned experiments, after the morning feeding. We observed that the morning
feeding is particularly important for better welfare and successful learning performance. This will
prevent the animal from being food deprived over a long period of time since the last feeding
time would have been the previous evening.
9.
Use a 7 mL plastic pipette and cut the ﬁrst 5–8 mm of the pipette’s tip to increase its cross-sec-
tion. This reduces the mechanical stress on the animals while transferring them. Pay attention to
always pipette the animal from its front or its back and never from the side. The animal’s length is
greater than the pipette cross-section therefore, if pipetted from the side, animal body can bend
unnaturally.
10. Place the animals immediately in a 50 mL falcon tube containing AFW at around 28C. Cover the
falcon tube (any opaque material is ﬁne) during transportation and avoid any sudden movement
of the falcon tube to reduce animals’ stress. We recommend avoiding taking the stairs if
possible.
11. Once in the experimental area, transfer the ﬁsh immediately to a petri dish in AFW, at G 28C,
and place it in an incubator (G 28C). We recommend to always store a bottle of AFW in the
incubator to have available pre-warmed AFW and avoid any thermal shock for the animal.
Note: Further ﬁsh handling and monitoring during chemogenetic ablation and the behavior
experiment are described later in the step-by-step methods details.

Protocol
 CRITICAL: It is crucial that the animals are never exposed to water colder than 25C to
ensure good health (see problem 1).
CRITICAL: Always wash the behavioral chamber before and after an experiment. Use RO
water ﬁrst and AFW later, to remove any olfactory trace.
CRITICAL: 3–4 weeks old zebraﬁsh are transitioning from larval to adult stage. During this
developmental stage ﬁsh size is a highly variable parameter. Hence, we recommend select-
ing animals of a similar size within the same age group (see problem 3). In our study the size
of 4 weeks old zebraﬁsh is in the range of 7G2 mm2 (Palumbo et al., 2020).
CRITICAL: As animals develop expression patterns of transgenic markers may change.
Larval zebraﬁsh usually display a broader unspeciﬁc expression of the Gal4:UAS construct,
which becomes more speciﬁc once the animal reach the juvenile/adult stage. Therefore, it
is a good practice to conﬁrm the transgenic expression patterns for chemogenetic abla-
tion once at larval stage and later at juvenile stage.
Note: Keep in mind that different genetic backgrounds/strains might lead to substantial dif-
ferences in animal behavior. It is important to design a control experiment in which you test for
the effect of the different transgenics strains. In our article we show that pigmentless nacre mu-
tants expressing Gcamp6s (Vladimirov et al., 2014) show no differences in CPA learning per-
formance, when compared to pigmented AB wildtype zebraﬁsh (https://www.ezrc.kit.edu/,

Timing: varies, up to 1 week
1. Software. To implement the custom-made real-time tracking software (Kermen et al., 2020, Palumbo
et al., 2020) we use the OpenCV 3.0 library and the QtCreator5.2 developing platform. With this STAR
protocol, we publish the source code to implement the Object class ‘‘Tracker’’, which would allow you
to create instances of ‘‘trackers’’ and allocate each of them in a different thread, if you go for a multi-
threaded approach. The only step you will have to implement is the image collection from a camera of
your choice and send them to the object for processing. Once processed, the object ‘‘tracker’’ will
return the detected position of the animals together with its size. For further details see documenta-
tions for source code, header and instruction on how to implement it in your code: https://github.
com/fabrizio-palumbo/Conditioned-behaviour-in-juvenile-zebraﬁsh.
2. Implementation. We use a class of algorithm called ‘‘Adaptive Background Gaussian Mixture
Model for foreground segmentation’’ (KaewTraKulPong and Bowden, 2002, Lech et al., 2014, Ziv-
kovic, 2004, Power and Schoonees, 2002).
a. The principle behind this algorithm is the following: the intensity value of each pixel in the im-
age is modeled by an adaptive parametric mixture model of N, typically three or ﬁve, Gaussian

 distributions (KaewTraKulPong and Bowden, 2002, Power and Schoonees, 2002). Once the
image has been modeled, the posterior probability is estimated, to deﬁne the current state
of the pixel: background or foreground (Power and Schoonees, 2002).
b. The implementation of this algorithm is described more in detail in Figure 1 and in attached
documentation,https://github.com/fabrizio-palumbo/
Conditioned-behaviour-in-juvenile-zebraﬁsh. Once the pixels corresponding to the juvenile
zebraﬁsh are identiﬁed their center of mass deﬁnes the animal’s coordinates in the arena (Fig-
ures 1A–1C). As a quality control of the detected ﬁsh, two criteria must be satisﬁed by the area
detected:
i. The size of the detected zebraﬁsh must be within a physiological range for the develop-
mental stage of the analyzed ﬁsh (1–2 week=2–4 mm2, 3–4 weeks= 4–10 mm2).
ii. The distance between the detected animal position in two consecutive frames must be
smaller than a threshold deﬁned by the physiological maximum velocity for the zebraﬁsh.
We use 3 cm displacement between two frames, corresponding to 66 ms, to avoid noise
detection from the distant borders of the arena.
c. The result of our tracking algorithm has proven to be very stable and reliable even in conditions of
weak contrast between the ﬁsh and the surrounding environment (Figures 1A–1C), compared to a
background subtraction algorithm in our assay. In our CPA training assay, image acquisition fre-
quency of 15 Hz was sufﬁcient to accurately track the ﬁsh without computationally overload the
software. An example two minutes’ pathway for one juvenile is shown in Figure 1D.

(A) Pixels corresponding to the zebraﬁsh are detected by the tracking algorithm.
(B) Dilations and erosion operations are performed to reduce the noise in the background pixels.
(C) Coordinates of the biggest area detected, which match the animal size range deﬁned by the user, are extracted

 Alternative: The approach we follow to implement our behavioral software is only one of the
possible solutions. It is worth to mention the recent sotfware package, Stytra (https://github.
com/portugueslab/stytra), published by Portugues lab (Stih et al., 2019). This software pack-
age provides a platform which will allow the experimenter to perform many different behav-
ioral protocols, requiring little programming knowledge by the user thanks to a user-friendly
interface and documentation.
3. Hardware. To implement the behavioral setup there are speciﬁc design requirements that are
important to maximize animal welfare and minimize external inﬂuence during the experiment.
We implemented a setup design, shown in Figure 2, which fulﬁlls the following requirements:
a. Prevent light\sound contamination from the surrounding environment as good as possible.
b. Prevent visual contact between the animals in different chambers during the behavioral
testing.
c. The water temperature should be maintained constant and never below 25C/26C. We used
a heater in the room to buffer temperature ﬂuctuations.
d. Prevent any intervention by the experimenter during the entire protocol.
4. Behavioral arena. To construct the behavioral arena using standard components, we recommend
Gosselin square shaped Petri dishes (120 mm 3 120 mm 3 15.8 mm). The walls of each arena
were covered with standard white opaque electric tape to avoid any interaction between the
ﬁsh in neighboring chambers. This is particularly important, since the juvenile zebraﬁsh exhibit
social interactions (Dreosti et al., 2015, Tunbak et al., 2020, Groneberg et al., 2020, Hinz and
de Polavieja, 2017). Using these large petri dishes allows the animal to explore the arena freely
Figure 2. Schematic representation of the behavioral setup that is used for conditioned place avoidance
Six square shaped petri dishes are placed on an LCD screen that display speciﬁc visual patterns from the bottom. A
high-resolution camera, Manta 235B (Allied Vision) with a wide-angle objective, is used to acquire images of the
animals. A custom-made software is used to acquired and process the images in real time. Depending on the protocol
that is performed, the software communicates with an Arduino Due that controls 6 separate non-inverting ampliﬁer
Opamp circuit for delivering the mildly aversive electric stimulation only when animals are detected in the
conditioned zone. Each arena is equipped with two tungsten wires, covering the entire length of it two opposing
sides. Figure adapted with permission from (Palumbo et al., 2020)

 without any restrictions and increase the richness of the behavioral repertoire. These small details
play a crucial role on the resulting behavior since we are not constraining animal movement and
enhance ﬂexibility. Finally, using square shaped petri dishes allows easier implementation of the
electrodes for establishing a uniform electric ﬁeld.
5. Electrodes. We recommend the use of inert tungsten wire electrodes, 12 cm of length and
0.25 mm of diameter, for delivering mild aversive electric stimulation to the ﬁsh. We observed
that tungsten electrodes were better than silver electrodes which showed toxic effects in water.
However, tungsten wires exhibit fast decay in conductivity due to the accumulation of ions over
one of the electrodes, generating a coating layer within few seconds under constant voltage. To
avoid coating and establish constant current, we use 10 milliseconds long 1.2 mA current pulses
at 1.33 Hz repetition rate and alternate the polarity on the electrodes between conditioning ses-
sions. All these additional measures prevent oxidation of tungsten wires throughout 2–3 h long
behavioral training sessions. This allows us to reuse the same electrodes across experiments ex-
tending their lifetime indeﬁnitely (we have used the same electrodes for 4 years now and they still
work well). (See problem 2 for troubleshooting)
6. Electric stimulation circuit. To deliver mildly aversive electric stimuli separately to individual ﬁsh,
we used an Arduino Due based circuit. Arduino board received 3,3 V digital input from the
tracking software, when the zebraﬁsh is detected in the condition zone, during conditioning
period, and delivered 18 V (10 millisecond, 1.2 mA current at 1.33 Hz) to each ﬁsh separately.
For each ﬁsh, a separate integrated circuit was built and used, connecting an Operational-Ampli-
ﬁer (Opamp, TLE2142 EXCALIBUR low-noise high-speed precision, Texas Instrument) in a non-
inverted ampliﬁed conﬁguration. The Voltage at the output is given by the relation (see Figure 2):
Voltage output = Voltage input

1 + Resistance 2

7. Visual stimuli presentation. Visual stimuli are presented to the ﬁsh form the bottom using a hor-
izontally positioned LCD monitor. The LCD monitor gives the ﬂexibility to change the visual stim-
uli, to control its timing, and to synchronize with other electronic systems.
a. We use a simple visual pattern dividing the arena half in red and half in gray colors. We match the
luminosity of colored illumination, when choosing the red and gray patterns marking different
compartment of the arena. This is important since zebraﬁsh respond differently to different illumi-
nation and ambient light levels (Spence and Smith, 2008, Avdesh et al., 2012, Oliveira et al., 2015,
Guggiana-Nilo and Engert, 2016, Cheng et al., 2017, Cheng et al., 2016).
Note: It is very important to keep the water in the behavioral chambers warm, which is crucial
especially for extended behavioral testing.
To ensure that the water in each behavioral arena never drops below 26C:
b. Measure the water temperature in each arena before and after performing a behavioral exper-
iment.
c. Perform the behavioral experiments in a heated room. We installed a passive heater element
in our behavioral room which helps to keep the room temperature around 26C over time.
8. Experimental design. When designing behavioral experiments, the ﬁrst rule you need to have in
mind is ‘‘minimize animals’ discomfort, while maximizing animal welfare and scientiﬁc rigor of the
experimental output.’’ To do so it is very important that you tune all the parameters of your behav-
ioral protocol with this goal in mind.
a. The stimulus design is a critical step when building a conditioned place avoidance task. We
chose the minimum stimulus intensity that elicits a brief escape response. We therefore
ll

Protocol
 recommend minimizing the intensity and the duration of the aversive electric stimuli to maxi-
mize animals’ welfare and consequently their performance.
b. The duration of each training and test session of the CPA protocol is another important param-
eter to optimize.
c. Additionally, we recommend verifying the CPA learning results by ﬂipping the color assign-
ment of the conditioned zone from red to gray, in separate CPA experiments.
d. We recommend our CPA protocols below.
Behavioral training
Timing: varies, 5h for steps 9–10, 4 days for step 11
9. Single day CPA training. For single day CPA training, we recommend the experimental design in
Figure 3. Also keep in mind:
a. Establish a long enough baseline session to ensure that the animals are relaxed and habitu-
ated to the environment, evenly exploring the arena without bias. We choose to have a base-
line session of 1 h. This will give you the opportunity to evaluate possible innate preference of
the animal for any of the arena parameters (location, pattern displayed, etc.). If a naı¨ve animal
displays a clear preference for speciﬁc compartment of the arena after a long baseline session,
it might be necessary to adjust the visual patterns to reduce such bias. We suggest to always
maintain a homogeneous luminosity all over the arena (Methods video S1).
b. Minimize the duration of the conditioning sessions, as much as possible. This will reduce the
discomfort of the animal, substantially. We recommend performing multiple short condition-
ing sessions, separated by test sessions.
c. Administrate the negative stimulus to the animal (1.2 mA for 10 ms at 1.33 Hz) every time the
animal enters the conditioned zone.
d. Terminate stimulus administration as soon as the animal exits the conditioned zone.
e. We recommend two 30 min conditioning sessions and two 30 min test sessions. Together with
a 1-h long baseline session, the experiment will last around 3 h, which has no negative impact
on animals’ health and welfare, as we show in our previous publication (Palumbo et al., 2020).
f.
We do not recommend protocols longer than 5 h (the longest duration we have tested). This
might have a negative impact on animals’ health since they will not be fed for a long time and
the water is not changed during the training.
Note: In our study (Palumbo et al., 2020), we do not observe freezing behavior or anxiety-like
phenotype in animal trained in 1 day protocols up to 5 h long. We therefore recommend to
keeping any behavioral protocol shorter than 5 h.
Note: We do recommend collecting the animal from the facility only when the behavioral pro-
tocol is ready to begin. This will allow the experimenter to transport the animal to the

gray, in separate CPA experiments. Figure adapted with permission from (Palumbo et al., 2020).

 experimental area and to initiate the behavioral training immediately. This will minimize the
total time the animal is handled outside the facility.
10. Sham-training experiments. In our recent study focusing on CPA learning in juvenile zebraﬁsh (Pal-
umbo et al., 2020), we proposed a sham-training protocol to distinguish the effects of animals’ aver-
sive experience due to mildly aversive electric stimulation (US), from the CPA learning related adap-
tations of animal behavior, as described in Figure 4A. This sham training protocol decouples
animals’ spatial position in the arena from animals’ subjective experiences in response to the deliv-
ery of electric stimuli (US). This allows us to compare the behaviors of CPA trained animals with sham-
trained animals with same subjective experience of the US. To do so:
a. Assign, for each animal which undergoes a training session, a sibling animal as a sham-con-
trol. Animals will undergo the training session in couples, one trained and one sham-
trained.
b. The two arenas need to be identical. We also recommend alternating the arena used for
training with the arena used for sham-training, in different sessions. This will control for
any asymmetry in the arena of which the experimenter is not aware of.

long; conditioning and test sessions are 30 min long with no delay in between sessions.
(B) Hardware conﬁguration of the behavioral setup to perform sham training. Each trained animal is coupled, via direct
hardwiring, to another animal which will be sham trained. During the conditioning session, mildly aversive electric
stimuli are delivered at 1.33hz to both animals simultaneously, every time the trained animal enters the conditioned
zone (red). We recommend verifying the CPA learning results by ﬁlliping the color assignment of the conditioned zone
from red to gray, in separate CPA experiments. Figure adapted with permission from (Palumbo et al., 2020).

Protocol
 c. Connect both arenas to the same stimulation cable, the one controlled by the trained ﬁsh
(Figure 4B). Doing so, both animals will be exposed to the same stimulation, controlled
exclusively by the trained ﬁsh.
d. Perform a new series of sham-training experiment any time a new training protocol is imple-
mented.
11. Multi-day CPA training. In our recent study, we showed that long term training of juvenile zebra-
ﬁsh leads to better CPA learning performance and memory recall (Palumbo et al., 2020). Such
long-term training is best achieved by multiple training sessions spread over consecutive
days. This allows the animal to rest, feed and recover between training days. Training juvenile
zebraﬁsh over multiple days requires the experimenter to plan animal husbandry and handling
accordingly. For multi-day CPA training, we recommend the experimental design in Figure 5.
Also, keep in mind:
a. Minimize the amount of time for transferring animals between behavioral chambers and tem-
porary holding between training days. After the ﬁrst training day, we keep individual juvenile
zebraﬁsh in petri-dishes (90 mm radius) in a 28C incubator from the end of the behavioral
training (circa 5:00 pm) until the next day training session (circa 10:00 am) We feed the ﬁsh
before placing them in the incubator. The next morning, we refresh the water and we feed
the animals 30 min before the start of the new training session.
b. We recommend, before performing a 30 min recall session, to begin each additional day of
training with a 30 min habituation session without any visual pattern presented to the animal.
This will allow the animal to habituate to the behavioral arena without eliciting any memory
recall related to the training visual stimuli, since they are not displayed. The arena is illumi-
nated with light gray, of the same luminosity of the pattern used on day1, see Figure 5 for
a graphical representation.
c. We recommend concluding each training day with a conditioning session (but not a test ses-
sion), as it might help promote memory consolidation.
d. Wash each behavioral chamber thoroughly with RO water, before and after each training day.
Figure 5. Schematic description of the protocol recommended for multi-day training in juvenile zebraﬁsh
Baseline and blank sessions are 60 min long, recall, conditioning and test sessions are 30 min long with no delay in
between sessions. During the conditioning session, mildly aversive electric stimuli are delivered at 1.33hz, every time
the animal enters the conditioned zone (red). Each day is concluded with a conditioning session to avoid memory
extinction overnight. From day two, each protocol starts with a blank session during which the animals are habituated
to the arena without any pattern presented. Figure adapted with permission from (Palumbo et al., 2020).

Protocol
 Behavioral analysis
Timing: varies, up to 15–30 min to adapt and run the codes we provide
For designing the analysis pipeline, we recommend using multiple complementary CPA learning
measures, some of which are also used in previous studies (Palumbo et al., 2020, Valente et al.,
2012, Millot et al., 2014, Yashina et al., 2019, Kermen et al., 2020). This approach allows quantiﬁca-
tion of animal behavior from different perspectives with different strengths and weaknesses.
12. We suggest quantifying the following parameters to assess CPA learning:
a. Average density of zebraﬁsh position in the CPA arena.
b. Relative time spent in the conditioned zone.
c. Relative swimming distance in the conditioned zone.
d. Animals’ distance from the boundary between safe and conditioned zones.
e. Conditioned Place Avoidance learning index (Palumbo et al., 2020).
f.
Swim direction near the boundary between safe and conditioned zone.
g. Avoidance of entry to conditioned zone, near the boundary between safe and conditioned
zones.
13. We suggest quantifying following parameters to assess animals state and health:
a. Swim velocity during the experiment.
b. Percentage of time that the zebraﬁsh exhibit no swimming (freezing), which we deﬁned as
less than 2 mm swimming for 2 s (adapted from (Agetsuma et al., 2010)).
c. Swim velocity, one second before (b) and after (a) the delivery of aversive unconditioned
stimuli (US).
Note: To see the implementation of these measures, please refer to the documentation in
https://github.com/fabrizio-palumbo/Conditioned-behaviour-in-juvenile-zebraﬁsh
and

Note: In order to have a complete and complementary overview of animal health and perfor-
mance, we highlight the importance of using multiple metrics while evaluating animal
behavior.
Chemogenetic ablation of speciﬁc neural populations in zebraﬁsh brain
Timing: 44 h
This protocol describes the use of a transgenic zebraﬁsh line Tg(narp:GAL4VP16; UAS-E1b:NTR-
mCherry) to ablate dorsolateral habenula (dlHb) neurons. This transgenic line expresses Nitroreduc-
tase (NTR) fusion protein tagged by a mCherry speciﬁcally in dlHb (Agetsuma et al., 2010) (Methods
video S2). As shown before in adult zebraﬁsh (Agetsuma et al., 2010), bath application of Metroni-
dazole (MTZ) chemogenetically ablate NTR positive dlHb neurons in juvenile zebraﬁsh (Palumbo
et al., 2020).
14. Prepare MTZ solution
a. Needed: 50 mL tubes, petri dishes (50 mL), aluminum foil, microbalance, vortex, and shaker
(see key resources table), incubator (G 28C).
b. Prepare 50 mL [10 mM] MTZ solution in a 50 mL tube. Fill the 50 mL tube with AFW and add
DMSO, subsequently add the MTZ powder. Proportion is described in Table 1).
c. Given the photodegradable nature of the resulting MTZ solution, wrap the entire 50 mL tube,
once securely locked, into aluminum foil and make sure that no light comes into contact with
the solution. Pay particular attention to this step.
ll

11
Protocol
 CRITICAL: MTZ is photodegradable. Prepare a fresh batch of MTZ solution for each abla-
tion protocol. 2 3 50 mL is needed for treating control and experimental groups
simultaneously.
CRITICAL: We recommend leaving the animal for at least 12h (overnight) in ﬁsh water after
removing them from the MTZ bath to allow the MTZ to wash out. During this time,
frequently refresh the water in the petri dish and feed the animal.
CRITICAL: Perform the behavioral experiments as soon as the MTZ washout is completed,
before any neurogenesis that might occur over the course of the next few days.
CRITICAL: As control animals, we recommend using sibling zebraﬁsh that do not express
the UAS-E1b:NTR-mCherry transgene.
d. Shake by hand, vortex thoroughly, and leave the tube on a shaker for at least 30 min, allowing
the metronidazole to dissolve properly.
15. Chemogenetic ablation
a. Before you start treating the animals make sure you have:
i.
23 50 mL [10 mM] MTZ solution
ii. Aluminum foil
iii. Fish already in the experimental area and fed prior to the treatment.
iv. Incubator at G 28C.
v. 1 petri dish must contain at most 3 juvenile zebraﬁsh.
vi. Prepare the ﬁsh ready for the experiment. Make sure that the ﬁsh had access to food
before the start of the ablation protocol. Limit the number of ﬁsh (max 3) per dish, to avoid
mortality due to hypoxia or excessive ammonia. Make sure that the animals to be treated
are size matched.
b. Fill two petri dishes with 50 mL [10 mM] each, and make sure the temperature of the solution
is not lower than 26C
c. Transfer the zebraﬁsh, one at a time in the petri dishes with the MTZ solution, using a 7 mL
pipette. Make sure to cut the tip of the pipette, as described earlier. To prevent reduction
of MTZ concentration in the petri dish, transfer the ﬁsh in a small bubble of water.
CRITICAL: We observed that the lower MTZ concentrations (1 and 5 mM) did not yield
desired effects in juvenile zebraﬁsh. Moreover 10 mM MTZ solution did not elicit any
toxicity or alteration of animal behavior in control animals of nacre or Ab wild-type genetic
background.
d. Label the petri dish with necessary information (ﬁsh line, date, experimental group, experi-
menters initial, etc.)
e. Metronidazole is light-sensitive, therefore wrap the dish in aluminum foil. Exposure to light
can decrease effectiveness of the ablation and will turn the ﬁsh water brown/yellow.
f.
Label the aluminum foil again with the same info as in point 3.
g. Place the petri dishes in the incubator (G 28C).

Protocol
 Note: Be extra careful when moving the dish around since even small movements can be very
stressful for the animals.
h. Incubate for 24 h in MTZ.
Note: For these 24 h, the animal will be kept in darkness.
i.
After 24 h, transfer the ﬁsh to a new petri dish containing clean ﬁsh water. Make sure to
refresh the water twice in each petri dish in the ﬁrst few hours after the MTZ treatment.
j.
Incubate again (G 28C) for 12 h in AFW. Make sure to feed the animal before incubating.
k. The next morning make sure to refresh the ﬁsh water in each petri dish and feed the animal at
least 30 min before the start of the behavioral protocol.
l.
The ﬁsh are now ready for the behavior protocol. Ideally start between 9 and 12 am, to keep
consistency for the timing of the experiments, and animals’ circadian rhythm.
16. Validation of chemogenetic ablation (Timing: 16 h)
To verify successful chemogenetic ablation of neurons we recommend TUNEL assay (Agetsuma
et al., 2010). The protocol was adapted from the manufacturer’s protocol (In Situ Cell Death
Detection Kit, Fluorescein, 11684795910 Roche) and optimized for whole mount labeling and
confocal imaging (Methods video S3).
a. Euthanize ﬁsh in ice cold water and ﬁx it in cooled 4% PFA in 0.25% PBTx (0.25% Triton X-100
in 13 PBS) for 12 h at 4C.
b. Permeabilizesamplesin0.050%Trypsin-EDTAonicefor40minandwash3timeswith0.25%PBTx.
c. Incubate the samples in 50mL TUNEL reaction mix for 1 h at 37C humidiﬁed atmosphere, in a
water bath covered by aluminum foil the dark. Subsequently wash it in 0.25% PBTx.
d. Place the samples on microscopy slides after washing steps in increasing glycerol concentra-
tion of 25%, 50%, and 75%. Then, use 75% Glycerol as a medium for mounting the samples
on glass slides for confocal imaging (see problems 4 and 5).
e. The TUNEL assay is based on detection of apoptotic cells. Apoptosis is a form of pro-
grammed cell death and can be affected by numerous factors (e.g., uptake of the drug, pas-
sage through the blood brain barrier, concentration, etc.). To visualize the ablated cells at
different apoptotic stages, we performed TUNEL assay at 16 h (Figure 6A and 6C) and
24 h (Figure 6B) after the start of the MTZ treatment. While apoptotic cells are clearly visible
in 16 h after chemogenetic ablation, 24 h after the ablation apoptotic fragments are less de-
tectible with TUNEL assay (Figure 6B).
Note: Zebraﬁsh brain have exceptional regenerative capacity (Celikkaya et al., 2019; Kizil,
2018; Cosacak et al., 2019; Lange et al., 2020; Kesavan et al., 2020; Schwarzer et al., 2020).
Therefore, we recommend that the behavioral testing is done no longer than 2 days after
the chemogenetic ablation, otherwise neuroregeneration may affect subsequent experi-
ments. We observed addition of new habenular neurons in juvenile zebraﬁsh, already
2 days after chemogenetic ablation (Figure 7; Methods video S4).
Note: Health monitoring. In the rare cases, if we observe that a ﬁsh has abnormal swim or no
movement, we euthanized these animals and did not perform any behavioral study
EXPECTED OUTCOMES
Once the conditioned protocol has been performed, following all the instruction described above,
the behavioral phenotype of the animal will replicate the one we describe in our previous publication
(Palumbo et al., 2020).
Most importantly, the animal will not show any 1) Freezing behavior, 2) Erratic swimming, or 3)
Thigmotaxis.
ll
OPEN ACCESS
STAR Protocols 2, 100465, June 18, 2021

Protocol
 The animal will spend most of his time in the safe zone of the arena once the training session is
completed.
For more details, in our publication (Palumbo et al., 2020) we provide several analysis of animal
behavior over the course of the behavioral training.
LIMITATIONS
We only detect the animal’s ‘‘center of mass’’ to obtain its position. We did not detect/analyzed an-
imal posture or animal swim pattern.
In our setup we did not implement a conditioned place learning protocol based on reward. This chal-
lenging task will require development of repeated and robust reward delivery systems that require
further design.
Implementing more computational power and higher spatiotemporal resolution of video monitoring
would lead to better image quality for posture estimation and allow the processing of larger number
of zebraﬁsh in parallel.

 TROUBLESHOOTING
Problem 1
During the baseline session, the animal shows reduced swimming behavior, with a high freezing time
(step 9–11).
Potential solution
Control the water temperature in the behavioral arena, it is likely too cold for the animal. Addition-
ally, make sure that the animal is fed before it is transported (always using warm water) to the exper-
imental area. Heating up the room in which you perform the behavioral training can also contribute
to maintain the right water temperature.
See Methods video S1 for an example of animal baseline behavior.
Problem 2
The animal does not respond to the electric stimulation during the conditioned sessions (step 5–11).
Potential solution
As a ﬁrst approach always make sure that all the hardware is properly connected and secured (no
loose wires around). Moreover, be sure of alternating cathode and anode across conditioning ses-
sions to avoid electrode passivation.
If none of the above solves the problem, then it is likely that the stimulus amplitude is the problem:
too low amplitude will not elicit any response from the animal, while a too strong stimulus will elicit at
ﬁrst a strong animal reaction, but it will quickly lead to a helplessness behavior. Therefore, pay close
attention to see in which of these two conditions you ﬁnd yourself and adjust the stimulus amplitude
accordingly.
Problem 3
The animal used for experiments at 3-week post fertilization is small in size compared to previous
experiments (step 9–11).
Potential solution
This is probably due to crowded nursery tank in the ﬁsh facility together with a non-appropriate
feeding routine. We do recommend keeping no more than 25 larvae per liter of water and feeding
them twice a day with dry food (morning and evening) and once with Artemia naplii (around 13:00)
(see key resources table). Keeping the waterﬂow outside the nursery net also improve animal growth
and health.
Problem 4
The ﬂuorescent signal of the whole mount TUNEL staining decreases with the imaging depth (step
16).
Potential solution
When dissecting the brain remove the skin and dura on top of the brain. This allows a better pene-
tration of the antibodies into the brain. Additionally, when imaging, make sure that the cover slip is
right on top of the brain, as close as possible. Pay attention however not to squeeze the brain.
Problem 5
The sample is not stable during the imaging process (step 16).

Protocol
 Potential solution
We recommend using a 4% gelatin - 65% glycerol solution as mounting medium. It improves the sta-
bility of the sample, since it has better mechanical properties at room temperature (20C G 2C) than
75% glycerol, which remains viscous.

The combination of local renewable energy production, dynamic loads, and multiple energy storage systems
with different dynamics requires sophisticated control systems to maximize the energy cost efficiency of the
combined energy system. Battery and thermal energy storage systems can be combined to increase the local
use of on-site renewable energy, reduce peak power demand, and exploit time-of-use energy pricing. In this
paper, we focus on how the augmented random search algorithm and artificial neural networks can be used
together to solve an energy cost optimization problem involving the control of a battery energy storage system
and a thermal energy storage system at the same time in a smart warehouse. As part of this work, a simulated
training environment made using the data from the smart warehouse’s operations. In addition to the energy
storage systems, the warehouse energy system has integrated a large roof mounted photovoltaic power plant
and an industrial-scale cooling system.
The developed solution is able to minimize the energy costs by modulating both energy systems, depending
on the situation. Additionally, when it is tested against the state-of-the-art solutions, our developed solution
at worst matches performance when the alternative algorithm is allowed to increase training time by a factor
of nearly three. On average, our presented solution doubles the performance of the benchmark algorithm with
much less computational resource expenditure.
1. Introduction
The current state of global energy supply and demand highlights
the need for controllable energy production and storage [1]. There is
an increasing demand for robust and responsive electrical and thermal
Energy Storage Systems (ESS) [2] as an increasing fraction of the
world’s energy demand is met by wind and solar power at the expense
of fossil-fueled and nuclear power [3]. The building sector represents a
natural candidate to deploy an algorithm controlling renewable energy
production and storage systems, as buildings are responsible for nearly
40% of global CO2 emissions [4].
Energy Storage Systems (ESS) can consist of various technologies
and be applied in a multitude of ways [5]. From the perspective of
the main electrical distribution grid, an important distinction exists
between centralized and decentralized ESS. As opposed to decentralized

ESS, centralized systems can be directly controlled by the grid operator.
However, decentralized ESSs are seen as an important component of
a more environmentally friendly energy system, but they come with a
new set of challenges [6]. The decentralized systems should monitor the
energy market, integrate the control algorithm with market dynamics,
and use it to reduce the peak load of the system while also minimizing
the costs. In the case of multiple ESSs with different dynamics, such as
a combination of a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) and Thermal
Energy Storage (TES), the complexity of the optimization problem
further increases.
One approach that is recently gaining a lot of interest in the sci-
entific community as a robust and self-improving method to control
building energy systems is Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms
[7]. RL algorithms can reduce costs by reducing necessary human

resource expenditure, and risks associated with their behavior can be
managed through off-line, data-driven training. Newer RL algorithms
often include training Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to output
desired actions or action values, showing improved performance [8–
10]. In contrast, Mania et al. [11] showed that the Augmented Random
Search (ARS) algorithm could achieve high performance with very
little computational resource expenditure by training a simple linear
function for action selection with their proposed search algorithm.
In this article we build on the work published in Opalic et al.
[12] where we showed that using ANNs for action selection together
with the ARS search algorithm improved the agent performance on a
BESS control problem. We now propose COST-WINNERS — a novel
approach to control, for the first time, both the BESS and TES of a smart
warehouse.
Specifically, our contributions in this paper are:
• We implement the ARS [11] RL algorithm, modified with ANNs to
encode the agent policy, to simultaneously control TES and BESS
energy storage systems.
• We build a data-driven simulated training environment, also mod-
eling the dynamics of the TES.
• Overall, we introduce a novel approach to control both the BESS
and TES of a smart warehouse simultaneously to reduce total
energy cost. This is important because combining different en-
ergy storage systems can lead to improved performance and cost
savings but also introduces new challenges due to each system’s
different dynamics and control requirements.
2. Related work
It was suggested in Xu and Shen [13] an algorithm for optimal
control of multiple ESSs using individual custom defined boundaries
for energy price. However, the study only features Battery Energy
Storage Systems (BESSs) and does not specify how to determine the
price boundaries for each system. Zhu et al. [14] examines decentral-
ized ESSs in urban railway applications and suggests multiagent deep
Reinforcement Learning (RL) for cooperative control using Q-learning
with recurrent ANNs. ANNs are also at the core of Model Predictive
Control (MPC) of TES developed by Cox et al. [15]. Zhang et al.
[16] propose Soft Actor-Critic (SAC, [17]) to optimize BESS control
with multiple energy production facilities. However, the authors have
not clarified if the experiment is based on more than a single 24-
hour episode and results are only compared with other simpler RL
algorithms. Goldsworthy et al. [18] have implemented a cloud-based
Model Predictive Control (MPC) battery control algorithm for energy
cost reduction at an office building. The system has been operational
for a year and achieved an energy cost reduction of 5.5%. Although
some of the related work show promising results, we were unable to
find any related work that examines advanced control algorithms for
energy cost optimization with multiple ESSs with different dynamics,
such as the BESS and TES in our smart warehouse.
2.1. Energy optimization in buildings
Similar to the Intelligent Energy Management System (IEMS) imple-
mented in the warehouse and described in our previous work Opalic
et al. [12], Sechilariu et al. [19] proposed Mixed Integer Linear Pro-
gramming (MILP) to optimize energy cost and power flow in a Direct
Current (DC) microgrid. Unlike the implemented smart warehouse
IEMS, it also features instant power balancing. A hybrid Model, sug-
gested by Huang et al. [20], uses MPC for energy cost optimization in a
case-study of an airport terminal. The authors suggest ANNs to account
for non-linearity. MPC using hierarchical MPCs to provide thermal
comfort and reduce energy cost was suggested in [21]. Smarra et al.
[22] propose a data-driven MPC, i.e., Data Predictive Control (DPC),
using a random forest algorithm for predictions, claiming that physical
models are impractical when considering the unique character and
complexity of building-related control systems. On the same line, Rätz
et al. [23] also explore data-driven energy system modeling for build-
ings using RL and MPC. For a twin BESS connected to a wind turbine
power plant, Wang et al. [24] suggest MPC. The authors assert greater
production dispatchability and increased battery life. To conclude, a
review study by Mariano-Hernández et al. [25] determined that the
most popular management technique in non-residential buildings is
MPC. They come to the conclusion that enabling intelligent control will
depend on the building modeling methodology.
2.2. Reinforcement learning
According to Sutton and Barto [26], RL is learning through discov-
ering which actions that increase a reward.
The operational concept of RL is often described as shown in Fig. 1.
An agent interacts with an environment, following its internal policy 𝜋,
by taking actions and receiving feedback from it as reward or penalty.
The policy typically gives the agent certain degrees of freedom to
choose actions that deviate from the strictest application of the policy.
This allows the agent to discover new states and actions that generate
higher reward, consequently updating its policy.
Well-known RL algorithms include Q-learning [27] and Deep Q-
Networks (DQN) [28]. The Q-learning algorithm maps each state to
the expected discounted future value of all the possible actions (Q-
value). In Q-learning, the agents’ policy is encoded in the Q-table, and
the deterministic version of it maximizes Q-value. DQN deploys a deep
ANN to compute the Q-values of available discrete actions given an
environment state.
The application of RL has been conducted in many different fields,
ranging from renewable energy to energy storage, and complex energy
systems. An example can be seen in Kuznetsova et al. [29]. The authors
developed a simulated microgrid, including a BESS and a wind turbine.
The methodology is based on Q-learning taking as inputs the BESS State
Of Charge (SOC), energy price, predictions of wind power production,
and energy consumption demand. The discrete action space includes
three possible BESS actions: charging, discharging, or none. Mbuwir
et al. [30] proposed fitted Q-iteration for transfer learning of BESS
control to and from systems with comparable properties. Wen et al.

[31] suggest adopting Q-learning and end-user device utilization for
controlling load shifting in modest office and apartment buildings.
Additionally, Henze and Schoenmann [32] also used Q-learning for TES
control.
Perera and Kamalaruban [7] found that Q-learning is the most com-
mon use of RL techniques in the energy research area, even if simpler
algorithms are still deployed. Importantly, there are also attempts at
exploring state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature. Mocanu et al.
[33] propose Deep Policy Gradient (DPG), similar to DQN, for on–
off load shifting in the residential sector. Focusing on residential BESS
control, a variant of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) [8] is
developed by Wan et al. [34]. Moreover, an improved DQN was imple-
mented also by Cao et al. [9] for BESS arbitrage. This algorithm takes
into account a lithium-ion battery degradation model, with discretized
action space for full or 50% capacity dynamics together with the stand-
by state. Shang et al. [10] combines DQN with bootstrapping and a
Monte Carlo tree search for BESS control in a microgrid. However,
in all cases except Wan et al. [34], the algorithms work in a discrete
domain, having limited action space. In addition, the reward functions
are generally complicated and experiment specific. Therefore, most of
the approaches mentioned are not ideal for large-scale implementation
of IEMS in a multitude of sites using RL.
Brandi et al. [35] explored control of a TES using online deep RL,
MPC and offline deep RL. For the online RL controller, energy cost
was increased by 160% for a four week period before it converged
to comparable behavior to the top performing MPC and offline RL
controllers. The study is limited to optimizing electricity cost incurred
by the chiller while disregarding overall building energy cost and
potential peak power cost.
Wang and Hong [36] conducted a survey of RL application to
control technical systems in buildings. The authors argue that estab-
lished techniques such as MPC requires extensive domain knowledge
to properly design and implement, making it less applicable in the
building control domain compared with mass production domains such
as the automobile industry. Furthermore, Wang and Hong [36] state
that RL combined with transfer learning should be further explored for
building control.
The authors in Xu et al. [37] propose a combination of RL with
differential evolution to reduce energy cost for industrial users with
solar power and thermal energy production, as well as BESS and TES,
while satisfying local energy demand and trading energy in an energy
trading platform.
2.3. Augmented random search
ARS is an optimization of what was named basic random search
by Mania et al. [11]. ARS is designed for continuous action space and
works with a strictly linear policy matrix, as opposed to other current
RL approaches. Moreover, exploration with the ARS is done directly in

as SAC [17], DDPG [8], TD3 [38], and Trust-Region Policy Optimiza-
tion (TRPO) [39], also operating in continuous action space, promote
action exploration with random noise added to the agents selected
action. In the ARS algorithm, random noise is generated and added
directly to the policy parameters and tested in the environment. The
rewards from 𝑁such tests, or rollouts, are then sorted in descending
order [11]. The top 𝑏directions are used to update the policy according
to

to 𝜃. Continuously updated mean and standard deviation of input
variables are used to normalize the inputs. Mania et al. [11] managed
to achieve outstanding performance while also drastically using less
computational resources when tested in a variety of well-known RL
benchmark problems.
3. Smart warehouse energy system
The energy system in the smart warehouse has previously been
described in detail in [12,40,41]. Table 1 lists its main components
and a scheme of it is visualized in Fig. 2. In this work we focus
mainly on describing the thermal components of the energy system,
and specifically the TES.
The main thermal components of the energy system are:
• the cooling plant with cooling energy distribution through evap-
orators based on direct expansion of carbon dioxide
• heat recovery from the cooling plant with hydronic heating en-
ergy distribution
• TES in an insulated firewater tank submerged in the ground.
• cooling for ventilation and server rooms with hydronic cooling
energy distribution
The physical characteristics of the tank are listed in Table 2. TES
specifications and model parameters are listed in Table 2. Additionally,
the energy system also features a BESS, described in detail in [12], that
is controlled simultaneously with the TES.
The TES is used to store both heating and cooling energy. Switching
between heating and cooling storage, on the other hand, incurs a

significant cost due to the difference in operational temperature levels
of the heating and cooling distribution systems at 50 ◦C and 25 ◦C,
and 9 ◦C and 15 ◦C, respectively. Therefore, the TES is used only for
heat storage in winter and for cooling storage during summer. For the
remainder of this paper, we focus on the TES in heat storage mode.
Since the TES is located underground, the ambient temperature also
remains relatively stable and is modeled as a constant temperature.
Excess heat is recovered from the cooling plant and can either be
directly distributed to cover the warehouse heating demand or stored in
the TES, or both. Available excess heat depends on the cooling demand
of the refrigerated areas in the building and will vary proportionally
to the cooling work done by the cooling plant. If available heat is
not sufficient to cover the heating demand, the remaining demand
can either be met by discharging stored energy from the TES or by
producing heat with an electrical boiler. The boiler can produce heat
at an efficiency of around 0.9, whereas using excess heat from the
cooling plant only incurs a small cost based on various operating con-
ditions such as internal operating pressure, operational temperature,
external cooling demand, and ambient temperature. Recovering and
storing excess heat for later discharge can therefore be defined as a
time-dependent optimization problem for energy cost reduction.
An IEMS currently controls the on-site ESSs by applying machine
learning to predict load and PV solar panel production [42]. Addi-
tionally, an optimization algorithm calculates a two-day plan for the
BESS and a TES deployment. The local Building Management System
(BMS) implements the schedule and updates it hourly. The current
IEMS system does not react to live operational data. Every hour the
system calculates another two-day schedule, implementing the first
hour’s actions. Therefore, the system is very dependent on accurate pre-
dictions for maximum energy storage and cost reduction. Furthermore,
in this scenery, it is challenging to prevent excessive peak power load
costs. The magnitude of the challenge is only amplified if we take into
account the structure used for the monthly peak power tariff, by the
local grid operator: the entire monthly peak power cost is dependent
on the highest hourly peak of that month. It is clear then that combining
long-term planning with short-term reactions is a key strategy to benefit
from the ESS’ capability for peak power shaving.
4. Methodology
In this paper, we examine the applicability of the ARS-ANN RL
algorithm to a complex energy cost reduction problem through direct
control of BESS and TES charging and discharging setpoints in a
simulated case-study smart warehouse. Our main research goal is to
examine if the ARS-ANN algorithm can efficiently control multiple ESSs
with different dynamics and substantially varying degrees of impact
on energy cost. The agent is trained in a simulated environment of
the smart warehouse, which we mainly designed through the use of
data-driven techniques. We have emphasized the use of data-driven
techniques as a way to reduce the need for human expertise to design
the simulated environment and increase the practical utility of our
approach.
4.1. Simulated environment
We have built the simulated environment on operational data us-
ing linear and polynomial regression in order to make the simulated
environment accessible for result analysis. As this potentially decreases
the accuracy of the system model, one could consider building a more
accurate model of the environment using deep learning neural networks
in an operational scenario. The methodology described in [23] or
similar approaches would then be considered. The current version of
the simulated environment features an ensemble of models of energy
system components and dynamics.
We use a model for the thermal energy storage, production and
distribution featuring:
• The heat exchanger temperature loss.
• Temperature loss through heat conduction to surroundings.
• 4 vertical internal temperature levels.
Important components and dynamics of the models for the TES,
production, and distribution are the following:
• Operational data of TES charging and discharging compared to
setpoint.
• TES storage loss and internal temperature levels.
• Cooling plant electrical power consumption and recoverable ex-
cess heat.
A schematic of the TES is included in Fig. 3. The schematic shows
the TES in the bottom visualized as a rectangular prism. Physically,
the TES is a subterranean concrete basin, insulated on all sides with

perforated water pipes (1, 2) placed diagonally along opposite walls
within. This allows for an even distribution of water flowing into and
out of the thermal storage, consistent with a strategy of maintaining
water temperature layering inside the tank. The direction of water
flowing through the tank can be reversed using an arrangement of
four two-way valves (3–6). The TES is physically separated from the
main hydronic energy distribution systems by a heat exchanger (8).
The flow volume on the TES side of the heat exchanger is automatically
balanced with the main hydronic energy distribution system using flow
measurements and a frequency controlled pump (7). Our model of the
TES includes the ability to reverse the direction of the flow of water
such that hotter water is always added to or extracted from the top
of the tank and vice versa for colder water. We have not included a
model of the heat exchanger due to the physical system automatically
balancing volume flow on both sides of the heat exchanger and the
observed temperature loss in the heat exchanger is minimal. Modeling
the heat exchanger could possibly be considered for future work.
On the secondary side of the heat exchanger, the TES is connected to
the hydronic distribution system in two ways (not shown in the figure).
Firstly, the TES is connected in parallel with all the thermal heat loads
with a modulating two-way control valve that controls the charging
according to an external thermal power setpoint. Secondly, the TES
can be discharged by circulating the combined return flow through a
modulating three-way valve that also responds to an external thermal
power setpoint.
However, the dynamics of the hydronic heating system is compli-
cated. We have therefore examined TES operational data in response
to charging and discharging set points. The examination shows a high
degree of variation between the actual delivered and the requested
charge, as well as a non-linear relationship between charging and
discharging dynamics. Therefore, we chose to model charging and
discharging dynamics with two different functions, using more recent
operational data. Charging dynamic is shown in Fig. 4(a), while the dis-
charging dynamic is illustrated in Fig. 4(b). However, we provide a TES
action space balanced around the origin of [−100, +100] to the agent
interacting with the environment. Actions below 0.2 and above −0.2
are regarded as standby, or no-action. The 𝑅2 score for the charging
and discharging functions is 0.83 and 0.53, respectively. A qualitative
analysis of the figures highlight a larger spread in the data point for
the discharge function. Importantly, although the 𝑅2 for the discharge
function is rather low, the goal of this function is to have a simple and
explainable model of the TES while discharging. The variation in TES
discharging, related to the setpoint, is known to depend on a multitude
of other variables when considering a priori and empirical knowledge
of the hydronic heating system and is beyond the scope of this paper. A
more practical way to model the TES dynamic, with a higher degree of
accuracy, is likely through the use of ANN and multiple input variables.

However, this would reduce model explainability, and it is not desirable
at the current stage.
In this article we have implemented the warehouse model described
in [40], and configured it to continuously calculate the refrigerant
mass flow in the cooling plants. We have fitted a linear regression
model, using pressure and mass flow of the refrigerant as inputs and

recoverable heat as output. Consequently, this model can be used to
find the recoverable heat upper bound at the maximum pressure of
80 bar and at any given refrigerant mass flow.
Moreover, we also model the electric consumption of the cooling
plant as a second order polynomial, using refrigerant mass flow and
heat recovered as inputs, and the electric consumption as output. The
R2 (R-Squared) score of the electric consumption function is 0.87, while
the RMSE is 11.17.
The cooling work, expressed as the refrigerant mass flow, represents
the limiting factor for the maximum heat that can be recovered. We
model this dynamic with a simple linear function, using as input
the refrigerant mass flow and returning as an output the maximum
recoverable heat.
Finally, there is a minimum amount of electrical energy required
by the cooling plant to keep the storage areas refrigerated. Also in this
case we chose a linear model using as input the refrigerant mass flow
and returning as an output the least required energy.
The following historical data sources were examined and used as
input for the smart warehouse model:
• Total power consumption and local power production.
• Cooling plant power consumption.
• Cooling plant mass flow [40].
• Heating demand.
• TES charging and discharging.
• Energy price for electrical energy bought from and sold to the
grid.
4.2. ARS with ANN
In [12], we implement a modified version of the ARS algorithm [11].
We deploy an ANN for policy parametrization in place of the linear
function proposed by Mania et al. [11], see Algorithm 1. We thereby
modify the processing of inputs to output from a linear to a nonlinear
function. More specifically, the ARS algorithm is used to train an ANN
to output actions for the TES and BESS with the input being the current
state of the environment. We take advantage of the functionality
for neural networks already implemented in the RLLIB programming
library. Refer to [12] for a detailed explanation of the implemented
solution. The algorithm in this article is based on the previously
suggested approach.
We use Pyomo [43,44], an open-source Python tool for optimization
modeling, with a GNU Linear Programming Kit (GNU Linear Pro-
gramming Kit (GLPK)) solver to calculate near-optimal solutions for
performance comparisons and benchmarking. We feed the GLPK solver
with all the information about the training scenario and it attempts
to find an optimal solution. However, due to the complex nature of
our energy system, we did not attempt to implement the TES in the
GLPK solver solution. We examined the operational data and found that
the electrical boiler had contributed very little to satisfying the heating
demand in the selected time period due to the fact that available excess
heat from the cooling system seemed to be sufficient. Reducing energy
consumption on the boiler is the main way that the TES can contribute
to lower electrical energy consumption during winter operation. We
argue that the impact of the TES on the energy cost in the time period
we pulled our operational data from is very limited. Adopting the
performance of the GLPK solver’s control of the BESS as a benchmark
is therefore still valid and useful.
5. Scenarios: Results and discussions
In this section, we investigate the application of the ARS-ANN
algorithm in a case-study smart warehouse, featuring both electrical
(BESS) and thermal (TES) energy storage systems. Therefore, we have
the opportunity of analyzing algorithm performance on a complex tem-
poral energy optimization problem. The objective of the algorithm is to
reduce energy cost by controlling charging and discharging setpoints of
both energy storage systems, BESS and TES.

5.1. Scenario I — proof of concept
In scenario I (i.e. first experiment), we apply the ARS-ANN agent to
control both BESS and TES for a random 48-hour episode. Our results
clearly indicate that the agent is able to find a near-optimal value for
BESS charging such that the peak power cost is reduced to a minimum.
Change in cooling plant electrical consumption due to control of the
TES is shown in Fig. 5, whereas total energy consumption and ESS
actions performed by the ARS-ANN agent are shown in Fig. 6. As we can
observe in Fig. 6 the maximum hourly energy consumption is flattened,
by utilization of the ESS, to around 512 kW, compensating for the
consumption peak at almost 600 kW that would occur in the baseline
consumption and contributing mainly in the reducing peak power tariff
cost.
The agent took advantage of the TES, when heating was required, to
reduce the electrical energy required by the cooling plant. It is relevant
to mention that the heating demand was very low during the random
episode used for experiment one. However, the ARS-ANN agent was

still able to find and store excess heat when there was no cost induced,
and then in turn used this to partially reduce electrical consumption by
discharging when necessary. Doing this, the agent was able to minimize
cooling system energy demand when heat was in demand.
5.2. Scenario II — seeded trials and benchmarking
To better quantify the performance of the ARS-ANN agent, we
compare it with a GLPK optimization solver in multiple seeded trials,
as well as benchmark it with other state-of-the-art RL algorithms. The
GLPK will be controlling solely the BESS, with perfect information, and
the comparison will be done for 10 seeded trials. Opposed to the GLPK,
the ARS-ANN agent will have control of both BESS and TES. We have

decided that comparing performance to an optimization algorithm,
with perfect information, of simultaneous BESS and TES control is out
of the scope of this paper due to the complexity. Additionally, the
operational data used to pull random seeded trials is from early winter
where the potential cost reduction of optimal TES control is minor
compared with BESS control. There are two main reasons behind this
choice of time period. Firstly, this was the time period with the most
available data requiring minimal amounts of data cleaning. Secondly,
we decided that observing how the algorithm performs in controlling
multiple systems with vastly different impact on the result would be of
interest.
The results of the simulation are displayed in Table 3. We observe
that for the majority of the trials, the energy cost reduction of the
ARS-ANN with both BESS and TES control either meets or exceeds
the cost reduction of the GLPK with BESS control only. For trial 10,
the algorithm seems to get stuck in a local optima where it charges
the battery too aggressively on the first timestep. Additional research
is required to explore why this happens and how it can be avoided
in the future. In the 4th seeded trial we observe that the ARS-ANN
outperforms GLPK by 21%. In this trial, the potential of cost reduction
using the BESS is quite low due to a relatively low baseline peak power
cost. Finally, we compare results for the SAC and TD3 RL algorithms
to the ARS-ANN algorithm solution, shown in Table 4. In Table 4 the
results for SAC and TD3 are compared to the results for ARS-ANN from
Table 3. Here, we can observe that TD3 seems to get stuck around
original while SAC actually performs reasonably well and even exceeds
ARS-ANN in a single trial, finally achieving an average performance of
50% compared with ARS-ANN. However, on a reasonable time frame
of running the algorithms for about a week of training time on 6
GPU’s and 96 CPU’s, both SAC and TD3 achieved similar results. It
was only after increasing SAC training time, by a factor of 3, to a total
of more than 3 weeks that these results could be achieved. Also, the
SAC algorithm results were not stable in the sense that the performance
does not stabilize at a high performance. In fact, it drops off entirely in
most cases. The results in Table 4 include the maximum award achieved
during each training session.
We also ran the seeded trials for the original ARS algorithm to quan-
tify the improvement represented by ARS-ANN. The results showed
that ARS performed at an average of 68% compared to GLPK over
the 10 trials and hence was outperformed by ARS-ANN by almost 30
percentage points.
5.3. Discussion
In this paper, we examine the applicability of the ARS-ANN RL
algorithm to a complex energy cost reduction problem by direct control
of BESS and TES charging and discharging setpoints in a simulated
environment of an operational smart warehouse.
To evaluate our solution, we use a GLPK optimization solver, con-
trolling only a BESS, as a benchmark. We have decided not to include
the TES in the GLPK solver for two main reasons: (i) our initial
 Journal of Energy Storage 72 (2023) 108202

data analysis demonstrated a marginal impact of the TES, and (ii) its
complex thermal dynamics. We argue that for this work a GLPK solver
with BESS represents a sufficient approximation to a good solution. We
show that for nine out of ten of our seeded trials, the algorithm meets or
exceeds the performance of a GLPK optimization solver controlling the
BESS only, while given perfect information. For the single trial where
it only performs at around 50% of the GLPK, the algorithm seems to
get stuck in a local optimum which is to be further explored in future
research.
We also compare our solution to state-of-the-art RL algorithms,
showing an average of 100% performance increase compared to the
SAC algorithm. However, the SAC algorithm was able to match or
slightly exceed the performance of ARS-ANN in a few seeded trials
when SAC training time was increased by a factor of 3. Further, the
best results for SAC were not maintained as the training progressed,
meaning that the performance declined after briefly achieving the high-
est performance for each training session. These ‘‘sparks of brilliance’’
could perhaps be leveraged in some way in future research. It would be
of interest, for future work, to investigate possible solutions combining
ARS-ANN and SAC for managing BESS and TES.
It is essential to mention that, due to time constraints and a lack of
additional data, we only tested our approach in scenarios in which the
heating demand was limited. It would be of interest, in future studies, to
explore a broader landscape of scenarios, with higher heating demand,
to evaluate the general efficacy of the method.
6. Conclusions
We demonstrate that we are able to minimize energy cost in the
considered warehouse. We are able to model the dynamics of the TES
and to use it in combination with BESS, controlled simultaneously by
the ARS-ANN agent.
We demonstrate that by combining BESS and TES with the pre-
sented ARS-ANN agent, the agent was able to stabilize maximum
energy consumption and thereby reducing the peak power cost. Ad-
ditionally, the agent was able to exploit the TES when the heat was in
demand to reduce the required electrical energy consumption by the
cooling plant and electrical boiler.
To conclude, we propose a novel approach to control both the
BESS and TES of a smart warehouse simultaneously to reduce total
energy cost. This is important because combining different energy
storage systems can lead to improved performance and cost savings
but also introduces new challenges due to each system’s different
dynamics and control requirements. The results conclusively show that
ARS-ANN outperforms comparable RL algorithms, achieving similar
performance to an optimization algorithm controlling the BESS with
perfect information.

Abstract—Proper conﬁguration of operating systems and pro-
gram parameters is known to be a key security factor in order
to remove vulnerabilities. It is known that vulnerabilities can
be caused by a human misconﬁguration or by an improper
chain of parameter settings. It is impossible to ﬁnd an optimal
combination manually due to the enormous number of possible
conﬁgurations. In this article, we resort to a Genetic Algorithm
equipped with a user-deﬁned ﬁtness function in order to compute
a conﬁguration of high ﬁtness.
Our work presents a two-fold contribution. First, we suc-
cessfully use a GA to implement a moving target defense by
alerting the conﬁguration regularly in order to spoil an attacker’s
reconnaissance efforts. The GA tightens the security solution
by evolving the ﬁtness of the conﬁguration over generations
while maintaining diversity within generations across a pool of
servers. This resulted in high-quality conﬁgurations crucial for
a successful moving target defense strategy.
Second, we try to ﬁnd a compromise between tightening the
security of the conﬁguration and maintaining the Quality of
Service (QoS) on a web server. In practice, usually tightening
security on a web server comes at the cost of a decrease in QoS.
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Background
The last two decades of the 21st century experienced an in-
crease in the penetration and expansion of digital technologies.
With the decrease in Internet access’ costs and information
processing, more people are using computers and they expect
a quality of service (QoS) compatible with the QoS they are
used to getting with other utilities [1].
This service is expected to be available continuously, from
anywhere at any time, secure, friendly, and reliable. People
expect to log on to the terminal, read mails, make reservations,
and do other activities, and with wireless technology, people
can access the Internet from anywhere [1].
Web technologies have evolved rapidly in the last ﬁve
years through web-enabled applications where browsers have
become the user interface. Critical functions are done through
web applications, such as money transactions, which make
web applications attractive targets for hackers [2].
The system can therefore be made more difﬁcult to ex-
ploit with better awareness, stronger operating systems, and
improved security defense. There is a need for a better
understanding of web applications’ security since the attackers
have moved from attacking the network layer to attacking the
application layer [1].
Web applications use the HTTP protocol over the internet by
using a web browser which makes it possible to access web
applications from anywhere [3]. However, Web applications
have bugs in their code that make them vulnerable and they
can compromise the system. These vulnerabilities are greater
in web applications than in other applications.
More speciﬁcally, the operations in a software are controlled
by a set of parameters such as the settings of the operating
system or the ﬁle permissions. These parameters affect both
the operating system and the application performance and
have therefore implications for the security posture of the
system [4]. Some conﬁguration parameters affect the security
individually and some do in combination with others.
Many cyber attacks are preceded by a search for vulnerabili-
ties within the network, often caused by a network misconﬁgu-
ration. Such threats can therefore be eliminated by tuning the
correct combination of parameters. Some operating systems
offer solutions to prevent security vulnerabilities. However,
there is a need for a low-cost method to conﬁgure network
parameters in order to prevent and defuse cyber attacks.
Genetic Algorithms (GA), a class of heuristic searching
algorithms, are applied in this article to discover new, secure,
and diverse parameter conﬁgurations by modeling a computer
conﬁguration as chromosomes, and the individual settings
conﬁgurations as alleles. The basic idea behind GA is: good
chromosomes will generate better chromosomes through a
series of selection, crossover, and mutation processes. These
processes are stochastic, ensuring therefore a high degree
of diversity in the outputs. Additionally, a population of
chromosomes can then continuously evolve to become more
and more secure in the current environment.
To improve protection against cyber attacks, a continuous
change of computer or program parameters conﬁguration can
mislead the attacker. The GA will ideally have changed the
conﬁgurations before the attacker is able to launch his attack,
turning obsolete the previously discovered vulnerabilities.

 Therefore, GA can signiﬁcantly improve cyber security by
changing the parameters’ conﬁgurations and increasing their
ﬁtness score.
B. Previous Work
A crucial characteristic, that any cyber security defense
algorithm needs to posses, is the capability to adapt to new
emerging threats and depending on the situation to choose
the best reactive action possible. The concept of learning has
therefore been applied already in the earliest form of the
autonomous defense system, being inspired by reinforcement
learning algorithms [5] and from biology itself, taking as
examples the immune system [6] and the defensive mutualism
in microbial symbiosis [7]. However, also cyber attackers can
learn and adapt over time [8]. As a consequence traditional
static defense techniques (i.e. ﬁrewall) are not successful
anymore [9]. The moving target (MT) defense approach has
therefore emerged and proved successful in increasing network
security [9]–[13]. The overall concept of MT is the following:
the machine conﬁguration changes as a function of time so
that it is more complicated for an attacker to exploit previously
identiﬁed weak conﬁgurations. Importantly, deploying learning
algorithms within the MT strategy can improve drastically
security by learning over time what parameter conﬁgurations
are particularly susceptible to cyber attacks [9]–[13]. The idea
of deploying evolutionary algorithms in the moving target
defense was already introduced in the early 2010s [14]–[17].
GA can play a crucial role in identifying new solutions in the
parameters conﬁguration space that would be more and more
resilient to cyber-attacks over time. The Works of Smith [18]
and Zhou [19] show that an evolutionary strategy is a powerful
approach when defending against cyber-attacks. Smith ﬁrst
investigates the application of GA to learn secure parameter
conﬁgurations, also called chromosomes, and to implement
the moving target defense (MT) strategy. A computer’s ge-
netic code, or DNA, includes all the settings of all of its
parameters. GA then evolves, over iterations/generations, more
secure conﬁgurations which are then used to immunize the
machine to attacks. In his work, Smith [18] also implements
a beam search-based system to select which chromosomes
are inherited across generations. This approach outperformed
GA in increasing average conﬁguration ﬁtness while still
maintaining high diversity. Experimentation showed that a
prototype system using these strategies, for a small number
of attacks per generation, was often successful in creating a
new generation of chromosomes that were immune to attacks
from the previous generation [18] [19]. Additionally, it is also
introduced the idea that the efﬁciency of GA is improved by
using machine learning to classify generated solutions and
ﬁltering the sub-optimal low ﬁtness conﬁgurations [18] [19].
Software conﬁguration consists of parameters and through
them, it is possible to control aspects of the system. Therefore,
a misconﬁgured software, by a single parameter or a combina-
tion of parameters, exposes the system to vulnerabilities. The
huge number of parameters makes it hard to identify vulner-
able settings that can be attacked. Moreover, combinations of
settings might cause hidden vulnerabilities, complicating the
problem.
A ﬁrst solution to the problem exploits the identiﬁcation
of common features across vulnerable conﬁgurations. In her
Ph.D. thesis, Dr.Oddell [20] developed a method to detect
security-relevant parameters. By analyzing conﬁgurations that
are vulnerable to the same exploit and comparing the similarity
of their parameters it is possible to highlight the ones that are
vulnerable to a speciﬁc attack. Genetic Algorithms are then
used to generate the conﬁgurations used for the identiﬁcation
of vulnerable parameters.
Another approach is based on the time of the incorrect
function of a system, which can be caused by errors in its
conﬁguration. In [21], the authors address the problem of
diagnosing conﬁguration errors. For example, changing the
local ﬁrewall policy could cause a network-based application
to malfunction. This approach searches the time point at
which the system transitioned into malfunctioning. The cause
of the failure is then identiﬁed by comparing the system
conﬁguration before and after the malfunction. Whitaker et
al [21] implement a tool called Chronus to reduce the need
for human expertise. Chronus automates the search for failure-
inducing state changes and identiﬁes the conﬁguration errors.
However, this tool requires, among other utils, user-written
software to ﬁnd out if the system is currently working and
only then ﬁnds the error.
A ﬁnal approach is presented by Zhang et al. [22]
and it is implemented in the tool called EnCore. EnCore
detect software misconﬁguration by taking into account the
correlations between conﬁguration entries and their interaction
with the executing environment. Encore consists of four steps;
data collecting, data assembling, rule generator, and anomaly
detection. It is able to learn a broad set of conﬁguration
anomalies that span the entire system and detect real-world
problems as well as injected errors.
The work presented in this article builds on previous
research and aims to improve on its weaknesses as follow:
• By using real parameters for each conﬁguration, allowing
us to replicate possible machine misconﬁgurations lead-
ing to attack vulnerability.
• By directly simulate attackers targeting the system, al-
lowing us to directly test the security level.
II. METHODS
This article uses Apache v2.2 conﬁguration parameters as
deﬁned in STIG [23], which stands for Security Technical
Implementation Guides. The STIG was developed by The
Defense Information Systems Agency in order to implement
conﬁguration guidelines for systems that are deployed across
the Department of Defense. The scores are based on the CVSS
scoring system [24], according to the results of the test code.
In this article, a part of the Apache v2.2 conﬁguration was
used as proof of the GA concept and its capability of ﬁnding
the ﬁttest solution.

 DiSA’s Security Technical Implementation Guides gather all
conﬁguration parameters that contribute to known vulnerabil-
ity attack paths.
STIG provides a network administrator with an explanation
on how these conﬁgurations can contribute to a vulnerability
and how it can be ﬁxed [23].
A. Genetic algorithm server
The chromosomes represent a conﬁguration’s combination
of parameters. The size of each chromosome is based on the
conﬁgurations’ parameters, where one allele or more represent
a parameter. In this research, the chromosome size is 25 and
the total number of chromosomes in one generation is 40,
which is enough to keep the parameters’ diversity according
to the number of parameters. The number of solutions in one
generation has been determined after many experiments of the
algorithm. It is possible to increase the number of chromo-
somes in one generation; this might increase the diversity, but
at the same time it would cost more computational resources.
All parameters are represented as a binary presentation, so
the parameter that needs to be integers is converted to integers
while converting the chromosomes into conﬁgurations. The
parameters represented as ”element from a list” are also
converted from binary to element from a list while converting
the chromosome into a conﬁguration.
Two algorithms have been developed and a total of four
scripts have been used.
• The genetic algorithm will generate security solutions.
• The ﬁtness score algorithm is responsible for providing
the genetic algorithm with the ﬁtness scores of the secu-
rity solutions. The scoring system relies on previous pref-
erences from STIG which provides the vulnerabilities, the
parameters responsible for them, and the solutions.
In the beginning, the ﬁrst chromosomes are initiated ran-
domly using a uniform distribution, and then saved to the
population’s pool.
In a Multi-point crossover, two or more random values
are selected and at these selected points, the variables are
exchanged between the individuals as shown in Figure 1.
Fig. 1. multi-points crossover
The experiments presented in Figure 2 and 3 show that
the multi-point crossover is more effective than the single-
point crossover because it increases the probability of the new
chromosomes getting the ﬁt parts of both parents [25].
If we consider the following two individuals with 10 binary
variables in each and the selected points are(4,7):
chromosome 1
0 1 1 0 →010→011
chromosome 2
0 0 1 0 →100→101
The generated new chromosomes would be:
chromosome 3
0 1 1 0 →100→011
chromosome 4
0 0 1 0 →010→101
Fig. 2. Single crossover
Fig. 3. Multi-point crossover
After executing the crossover function it is necessary to
run a mutation process in order to prevent the algorithm from
being trapped in a local minimum. The mutation is an operator
which maintains genetic diversity within the population. The
mutation process introduces a new genetic structure into the
population by modifying some of the alleles. [25].

 In this article, binary representatives were used, so the
mutation process was done by ﬂipping a random allele in the
chromosome to the opposite value as shown in the following
example:
If we consider the following two individuals with 10 binary
variables in each and the selected allele location is 5:
chromosome 1
0 1 1 0 —0 — 1 0 0 1 1
In the mutation process, it would ﬂip the value from 0 to
1, so the generated new chromosome would be:
chromosome 2
0 1 1 0 —1 — 1 0 0 1 1
After executing the crossover and mutation process, the
algorithm divides the existing solutions in the population’s
pool between the available docker containers in the farm. This
is done to compute the ﬁtness scores and select the ﬁttest
solutions of the whole population. We then select the best n
solutions for further mating and to produce the next generation.
When the algorithm sends the solutions to the web servers,
it makes sure it sends them only to available web servers. It
checks their availability before sending the solutions in order
to avoid any future errors, and ensure that all the solutions are
tested as planned. After sending the solutions to VM’s farm,
the algorithm opens a port temporarily to receive the scores
for each solution. After receiving all the scores, the algorithm
selects the n ﬁttest solutions for further mating.
The algorithm runs 40 generations and the experiments
show that 40 generations are good enough to reach a solution
close to the optimal ﬁtness. However, the generation number
can be increased in case of the need to improve a more
complex chromosome to optimize the solution.
B. Reconﬁguring the Apache server
The Genetic Algorithm generates solutions and sends them
to the VMs farm which then applies those conﬁgurations to
the Apache server in order to execute the automated attacks.
The VM receives the solutions as a list and through an agent
script, it translates the list into conﬁgurations and then applies
them to the Apache server.
C. Quality of service
It is important to make sure that a good QoS is maintained
while tightening the security.
The QoS was measured by the total used time for the
following processes: Lookup time, Connect time, Pre-transfer
time, and Start-transfer time. The total used time was measured
by running the ”curl” command while pressing the web
server using ”httperf” on two web servers; one web server
with the ﬁttest conﬁguration, and another with a vulnerable
conﬁguration. The experiments on both web servers were done
under the same conditions which contain six load stress levels.
The experiment was run 10,000 tests/webpage requests on
each web server on every stress load level which makes it
60,000 tests/webpage requests in total on each web server,
where each level had a different load rate generated by httperf
tool, and is this explained in more detail later.
III. RESULTS
A. Security solutions
In this article we show experimentally, by using real pa-
rameter conﬁgurations and simulated cyber-attacks, that evolu-
tionary algorithms represent a powerful tool to improve cyber
security.
The experiments were conducted using conﬁgurations of 24
Apache 2.2 parameters.
We show that by using GA it is possible to improve system
security over the course of generations. Through iterations
of trial and error, we identify that the best performance was
achieved by:
• using a population size consisting of 50 individuals.
• running for 40-45 generations.
• One or two genes are modiﬁed in every mutation, using
elitism as the deterministic tournament selection, and
using a two-point crossover.
The start point solution was initialized randomly. In the
documented experiment, the initialized solution was 1035.2
when using a one-point crossover, and it was 1011.6 when
using a two-point crossover. The ﬁttest solution was 1490.0
when using a one-point crossover and 1584.2 when using a
two-point crossover as shown in Figure 4.
The experiment shows maintenance of diversity which is
required in order to ensure the solution space is checked
thoroughly enough, especially in the earlier stages of the
process. Population diversity is considered to be the main
reason for premature convergence.
The experiment also shows that the diversity was high in
the start and it became lower and lower in the later stages,
as shown in Figure 5. The results also show that crossover
types signiﬁcantly impacted ﬁtness or diversity in this article,
as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3.
A high diversity in the population generates a different
solution from generation to generation implementing a moving
target defense. This results in wasting the attacker’s reconnais-
sance effort by changing the conﬁgurations continuously until
reaching the ﬁttest solution possible.
To quantify the impact of our approach on the QoS for the
user, we focus on the total time used between establishing a
connection and data transfer, as shown in 6. The mean value
of the total time of all test levels for the web server with
the ﬁttest conﬁguration was 0.004062783, while for the web
server with the vulnerable conﬁguration was 0.002006883.
Therefore, using the ﬁttest conﬁguration solution increase the
time necessary to send the requested page, compared to the
vulnerable solution.
B. Fitness score
This article investigates the role of the GA in improving
cyber security. We deﬁne a ﬁtness value for each chromosome,
as an estimate for security. Those values were then used to
select conﬁgurations with higher ﬁtness values.
The ﬁrst scores were decided according to randomly gen-
erated chromosomes, which varied from one experiment to

another. Then, the GA performed the selection based on those
scores. Crossovers also used the same scores to decide which
chromosome moves forward, which are based on random
selection and affect the evolution process.
The mutation process took place after the crossover with
randomly selected candidates preventing the algorithm to fall
into local minima.
The scoring system was built over the course of three
experiments:
• An ofﬂine scoring system based on information from the
STIG database.
• An online-scoring system based on the OWASP vulner-
ability scanning
• Real-life attacks were executed on both the most vulner-
able solution and the ﬁttest solution
The GA successfully generated a more secure conﬁguration

that was not vulnerable to real-life attacks.
The QoS is an important factor to consider while improving
the security solution. The conducted experiment shows that
tightening the security does affect the QoS.
The experiment reported in Figure 6 and Table 1 shows a
signiﬁcantly longer time required for secure conﬁguration to
start transferring once a connection is established. The average
time used by the ﬁttest conﬁguration was 0.004062783, while
the average time used by the vulnerable conﬁguration was
0.002006883 which is a signiﬁcant difference.

More investigation and experiments are required in the QoS
area to make a concrete analysis. Time constraints made it
impossible to conduct a more thorough investigation in this
article.
The total ﬁtness (100%) in this article was deﬁned as:
• the conﬁguration ﬁtness (70%)
• Moving target success (10%)
• the 2 attacks experiments’ success (10%)
• the QoS ﬁtness (10%)
The Conﬁguration’s ﬁtness was calculated according to the
expected highest ﬁtness (1700), and the ﬁttest solution was
1584.2. The moving target was calculated according to the
change in every ﬁve generations: a change in the conﬁguration
in every ﬁve generations is considered a ﬁnding. The 2attacks
score was deﬁned by the success or failure of the two
cyber attack strategies tested: Denial of service and buffer
overﬂow. The QoS ﬁtness was calculated according to how
many of the 60000 tests still got a comparable response time
between the case of the ﬁttest security solution and the case
of a vulnerable solution (<0.006s), which was 45620 in the
conducted experiments.

IV. DISCUSSION
This article shows that GA can contribute to reducing sys-
tem vulnerabilities by detecting and solving misconﬁguration.
The GA evolves ﬁtter solutions within every iteration, reducing
vulnerabilities over generations.
Vulnerabilities caused by human misconﬁguration are hard
to ﬁnd manually, due to the huge number of parameters, and it
is even harder to ﬁnd the right chain of parameters. However,

 GA can automate this process and provide more and more
accurate solutions over the course of generations.
The implemented algorithm aims to ﬁnd the ﬁttest conﬁg-
uration in Apache 2.2 server, ﬁxing the vulnerabilities caused
by human misconﬁguration. This algorithm can then replace
manual human work which is impossible to consider due to
time constrain.
The GA manages to reach the ﬁttest solution possible
through 40 generations, ﬁnding the correct parameters and the
correct chain of parameters.
The GA preserves diversity within each generation and
maintain a diverse solution from generation to generation. This
is particularly important since it can mislead an attacker that
has done reconnaissance between the generations.
A. Fitness
The main objective of this article is to reach the ﬁttest
solution through the use of GA. The ﬁtness function showed
ﬂexibility in a constantly changing environment. The ﬁtness
of the chromosome is based on a discovered security concern
that has been run through the penetration test. The test sends
back the security level of each chromosome with the goal to
reach as few vulnerabilities as possible.
The CVSS score of a parameter setting, which has been
used to score the security, is based on the effect it might cause
on information security such as conﬁdentiality, integrity, and
availability.
The scoring system starts with simulated attacks, based on
information from STIG. In the second step, the scoring system
is developed to run a vulnerability scanning using OWASP,
showing results close to the simulated attacks. Finally, the
security level is tested through real-life attacks, showing results
as expected.
B. Moving target
Implementing a moving target defense strategy is an ob-
jective of this article. It protects from attacks by changing
parameter conﬁgurations continuously, so in case the attacker
did his reconnaissance, it would be non-effective because
of the change in the conﬁguration. Diversity is therefore an
important factor during the evolution process to implement a
moving target defense within each generation.
Keeping the diversity of high-quality conﬁgurations is
important within the moving target strategy since different
conﬁgurations are applied on a number of machines.
The difference between the ﬁtness of two different solutions
in one generation represents the diversity within a generation.
The diversity from generation to generation is calculated by
looking at the differences between the ﬁttest solution in the
generation and the following generation.
In this article, the diversity is maintained across generations
which implements a moving target defense until the ﬁttest
solution possible is reached. This misleads an attacker in case
of conﬁguration reconnaissance. The diversity also prevented
the algorithm from falling into a local minimum, which helped
it to evolve the ﬁttest solution.
C. Quality of Service
Improving security is an important factor, but at the same
time, it should be parallel with having good QoS. In this
article, the QoS was investigated in order to see if there is any
noticeable relation between security and QoS. The conducted
experiments do show a negative impact on the QoS when
improving security, in terms of total used time between when a
connection was established and when the data actually began
to be transferred. The impact was measured while the web
server was under continuous stress of HTTP requests load. The
average used time, from starting the connection to starting the
data transfer, signiﬁcantly increase for server conﬁgurations
with tighter security.
V. CONCLUSION
The objective of this article is to improve the security so-
lutions by applying the genetic algorithm to the conﬁguration
parameters of Apache2.2. The genetic algorithm is applied
successfully allowing the conﬁgurations to evolve to be diverse
and more secure over generations. Additionally, this approach
also allows for a moving target defense by changing the
conﬁguration from generation to generation until reaching the
ﬁttest solution possible.
Vulnerabilities can be caused by a misconﬁguration or by
an unlucky chain of conﬁgurations. This is difﬁcult or even
impossible for the system administrator to discover manually
due to the huge amount of parameters, and big amount of
possible combinations. Therefore, a Genetic Algorithm was
used to ﬁnd more secure conﬁgurations. Conﬁgurations were
represented as chromosomes and the GA took those through
a series of selection, crossover, and mutation processes which
resulted in more secure conﬁgurations across each generation.
The results demonstrate the performance of the evolu-
tionary approach for managing conﬁgurations consisting of
24 parameters from Apache 2.2. The simulated attacks of
these conﬁgurations are based on information from the STIG
database. The genetic algorithm discovers better parameter
settings for the attacked parameters in each generation.
At the ﬁrst stages, the solution ﬁtness improves signiﬁcantly.
A reasonable level of diversity is maintained. It starts with a
high level of diversity because the parameters are randomly
initialized. In the late stages, the ﬁtness improvement decrease
alongside a decrease in diversity.
The experiment showed that the diversity within the gener-
ation maintained the ability to have a diverse conﬁguration
from generation to generation. Changing the conﬁguration
from generation to generation creates a moving target that
misleads an attacker based on reconnaissance.
In terms of security, this experiment demonstrates resilience.
As an added contribution of this paper, the genetic algo-
rithm manages to ﬁnd the ﬁttest solution possible, which helps
prevent attacks caused by a misconﬁguration or by a poor
chain of parameters. This is considered to be a new concept
in improving security.
As an added contribution of this paper, the genetic algo-
rithm helps prevent attacks by spoiling an attacker‘s recon-

 naissance efforts by continuously changing the conﬁguration.
A series of changes in the conﬁguration from generation to
generation makes it possible to enhance security by deploying
a moving target defense.
As an added contribution of this paper, the investigation
of the relationship between security and QoS shows that the
security level has a signiﬁcant impact on the QoS. Improved
security results in a longer time delay between establishing
the connection and the start of data transfer. This might be
a reasonable price to pay for having a higher security level.
However, to be more concrete about the impact of this delay
on the QoS, it is recommended that further investigation -as
future work- covering other areas in QoS are conducted.

ABSTRACT
Data journalists are increasingly reliant on automation and artiﬁcial
intelligence (AI) to process and analyse massive datasets. AI can
contribute to journalism by creating visualizations, verifying
accuracy of information, analysing historical data, monitoring
social media, ﬁnding patterns and outliers, generating text and
much more. However, the integration of AI into the newsroom
comes with its own challenges. In this article, we take a practice-
based approach to develop a deeper understanding of how to
overcome such challenges. Our teams of data scientists, AI
experts and journalists took on four projects incorporating data
science and machine learning into investigative journalism. From
those experiences, we found that access to data at scale, data
quality and reworking the concept of “newsworthy” as a machine

Introduction
Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) is a broad ﬁeld of computer science that aims to develop intel-
ligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.
Machine learning is a subset of AI that develops algorithms and statistical models
enabling computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly
programmed by humans. AI also includes other approaches such as natural language pro-
cessing, computer vision, expert systems, and robotics, which collectively enable AI
systems to understand, reason, learn, and interact with humans and their environments.
Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is being rapidly adopted by news media around the world, to
the point that both the public and the journalists themselves start to wonder whether
“robots will replace journalists” (Miroshnichenko 2018). However, while the adoption of
AI in journalism is accelerating, experiential knowledge about AI applications in

 journalism is lagging. Research on AI in journalism has been mostly qualitative and
focused on a few topics such as data journalism, robotic writing, and news review
(Parratt-Fernández, Mayoral-Sánchez, and Mera-Fernández 2021).
With the advent of digital technology and the explosion of data, it is becoming increas-
ingly important to use AI to support investigative journalism, as traditional methods are
no longer practical. The development of new, often open-source, tools makes solutions
easier and faster to implement and requires fewer specialized resources. In this context,
computers can play a central role in automating repetitive and computationally intensive
processes, enabling journalists to extract information that would otherwise be inaccess-
ible (Beckett 2019). To visualize the growth in automated data handling it´s enough to
consider that the “Pandora Papers”, released by ICIJ and composed of 2.94TB of docu-
ments, is 1700 times as large as the “2010 Wikileaks”, which was 1.7GB (Infographic
2021; Pandora Papers 2021).
Upon examining the current research landscape, it is evident that two main research
strands are prominently featured in the ﬁeld: reports by journalists and/or developers
describing a speciﬁc use case, and research articles based on interviews, surveys, and lit-
erature reviews (Ausserhofer et al. 2017; de-Lima-Santos and Ceron 2022; Stray 2019a).
However, the complex nature of investigative journalism requires alternative and exper-
imental research methodologies that enable researchers to understand and analyse often
novel investigative methodologies. One of the biggest challenges for multidisciplinary
teams working on AI in investigative journalism is to be able to communicate and collab-
orate eﬀectively (Santos and de-Lima-Santos 2022).
This article draws on the insights and experiences gained from participation in four
interdisciplinary teams in which data scientists and journalism researchers collaborated
with investigative journalists on various projects. Our goal is to analyse how interdisciplin-
ary teams can overcome the problems and limitations identiﬁed by researchers such as
Stray (Stray 2019a) and lead to a better inclusion of AI methods in investigative journalism.
By understanding the problems that need to be addressed, this paper aims to develop
better methods for incorporating AI into investigative journalism.
Data Journalism and AI in Journalism
Data journalism is a ﬁeld that incorporates data analysis, visualization, and database use
with traditional journalism practices to uncover and tell stories. Data journalism has made
substantial contributions to society, oﬀering information and insights that have led to
increased transparency, accountability, informed decision-making, and public under-
standing (Bounegru and Grey 2021). Data visualization is a critical aspect, as it helps jour-
nalists present complex information in a simple format (Rodríguez, Nunes, and Devezas
2015). Using data and interactive visualization, data journalism has revealed injustices,
held powerful individuals accountable, and improved the functioning of society and
the lives of citizens (Ausserhofer et al. 2017; Borges-Rey 2016; Bounegru and Grey 2021;
Santos and de-Lima-Santos 2022; Young, Hermida, and Fulda 2018).
There has been a push to include more data science and AI in data journalism. Data
journalism and AI journalism are two diﬀerent approaches to journalism that can
overlap. Data journalism involves the use of statistical methods, data visualization tools,
and other techniques to identify patterns and trends in large datasets, and to present
2

 this information in a way that is accessible to the general public. AI in journalism addition-
ally involves using AI technology to analyze data and discover, develop and publish new
stories. Whereas the most used software by data journalists are Microsoft Excel and
Google Sheets (The State of Data Journalism 2023), data scientists regularly use program-
ming to wrangle and scrape data, improve data cleaning, and create custom analysis and
dynamic interfaces to promote data interaction. They can also use machine learning and
recent AI advances to automate repetitive processes, extract relationships that are hard to
see otherwise and detect newsworthy anomalies (Amazon Mining Watch n.d.). Data jour-
nalists are now more reliant on automation and AI to process and analyse massive data-
sets, and even generate new stories (Challenges and Opportunities – Survey – State of
Data Journalism 2022, n.d.). Florian Stalph identiﬁes four main categories of data journal-
ism: explanatory data journalism, investigative data journalism, interactive data journal-
ism, and advocacy data journalism (Stalph 2018). A similar approach is followed by
Konstantin Nicholas Dörr mapping the ﬁeld of AI journalism into automated news
writing, data-driven journalism, personalized news recommendation, and algorithmic
curation (Dörr 2016). In addition, AI can contribute to journalism by creating visualiza-
tions, verifying the accuracy of statements, analysing historical data, and monitoring
social media (AI and the Future of Journalism n.d.; Hacks/Hackers LDN 2019; Miroshni-
chenko 2018; Weber 2021). However, it is important to view AI as an aid to journalists,
not a replacement. The best outcomes are achieved by combining AI with human exper-
tise and ensuring unbiased and diverse data is used for training.
Data collection is a critical aspect of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) because AI algorithms
rely on large and diverse datasets to make accurate predictions and decisions. However,
data collection for AI can be problematic due to several reasons. First, it can introduce
bias and discrimination if the collected data reﬂects societal biases or discriminates
against certain groups, leading to unfair outcomes (Buolamwini and Gebru 2018;
Zhao et al. 2018). Second, limited or incomplete data can result in models lacking accu-
racy and reliability (Jain et al. 2020). Moreover, privacy concerns arise when personal
data is collected, stored, and potentially used without consent, posing risks to
privacy and data security (Crawford and Schultz 2014). Ethical considerations are also
important, especially when sensitive information is involved, requiring transparency
and adherence to ethical guidelines (O’Neil 2016). Data quality and pre-processing chal-
lenges, including errors and inconsistencies, can undermine AI model eﬀectiveness.
Data imbalance, where certain groups are underrepresented, can lead to biased
results. Additionally, data ownership and access rights can create barriers to research
and fair competition.
The research into data journalism is an ever-evolving ﬁeld, but a few trends are emer-
ging. Several studies highlight the importance of multidisciplinary teams (Borges-Rey
2016; de-Lima-Santos & Salaverría 2021; Santos and de-Lima-Santos 2022). Collaborations
between journalists, data scientists, and developers to create tailored analyses and data-
wrangling solutions are key to an investigations’ success. Teams that instead have to rely
on readily available free online tools struggle with the lack of customization (Young,
Hermida, and Fulda 2018).
Despite the potential beneﬁts, the adoption of AI in the ﬁeld of investigative journalism
has not been widespread. The cost of implementing new technologies, like AI, in various
industries may be a factor. However, there is potential for AI to reduce costs as well, in the
JOURNALISM PRACTICE

 scope of automation and lead generation. In addition, given its potential to recognize pat-
terns and ﬁnd stories that would otherwise stay buried, the cost-beneﬁt analysis cannot
be calculated purely in ﬁnancial terms. This value to society allows such projects to turn to
public funds, philanthropy, and crowdfunding.
Apart from the economical hurdles to incorporating AI and data science into data jour-
nalism, there are also the obstacles inherited from data journalism itself. These challenges
are well explained in a comparative study between the United States and North European
countries (Fink and Anderson 2015). Fink and Anderson summarize the main limiting
factor for data journalism across newsrooms in the lack of: Time, Tools, Manpower and
Legal Resources. They also point out that the role of a data journalist within an organiz-
ation often lacks clear deﬁnition, frequently resulting in them either working in isolation
or being burdened with an overwhelming amount of tasks.
An overview of the pros and cons of AI integration within newsrooms is given by Wu
et al. after conducting interviews with professionals. In their work, they discuss the emer-
gence of automation technologies, such as artiﬁcial intelligence, machine learning, and
natural language processing, and their potential applications in journalism. They
explore how these technologies are being integrated into newsrooms to streamline
workﬂows, generate news content, and personalize news delivery. Some of the potentials
of AI consist of increased eﬃciency, improved accuracy, and enhanced audience engage-
ment through personalized news experiences. At the same time, concerns are related to
job displacement, ethical considerations, and the need for human oversight in the auto-
mated news production (Wu, Tandoc, and Salmon 2019).
Nevertheless, AI journalism can play a crucial role in supporting the role of journalists
as “watchdogs”, to quote Tom Felle (Felle 2016), in providing the public with valuable
information and holding those in power accountable for their actions. Of course, this
comes not without challenges, but by focusing on disclosing sources, methodologies,
and limitations journalists can enable audiences to assess the credibility and reliability
of data-driven news stories (Anderson 2018; Zamith 2019).
Methodology
Parratt-Fernández et al. observe that 60% of academic work on AI applications in journal-
ism utilizes qualitative methods, despite the numerical nature of the subject. While digital
methods are prevalent in digital humanities, they are less common in journalism studies
(Parratt-Fernández, Mayoral-Sánchez, and Mera-Fernández 2021). Sjøvaag and Karlsson
attribute this to a higher threshold for journalism scholars, who often lack the necessary
skills and knowledge to perform automated analysis on large datasets (Karlsson and
Sjøvaag 2016). We have consequently chosen to develop and employ alternative method-
ologies to enrich the existing literature from complementary methodological perspec-
tives. The methodology used in this research is practice-based (Biggs and Büchler 2007;
Vear 2022).
Practice-based research emphasizes the study of real-world problems and practices,
rather than solely theoretical or abstract concepts. In contrast to other methodologies,
practice-based research focuses on understanding how people actually do things,
rather than how they should theoretically do them. This allows us to focus on how inves-
tigative journalists do their job. It is an empirical research method, which is based on the

 collection of data through observation, discussion, and other forms of direct engagement:
practitioners and researchers work together to identify research questions, collect data,
and analyse results.
Practice-based research allows journalists and scholars to better understand the
practical implications of new technologies and changing newsroom practices. It is
necessary to bridge the gap between academic research and industry practice
and can lead to the development of more innovative and eﬀective journalism
(Barroca et al. 2018; Biesta 2007). In addition to its beneﬁts for practitioners, prac-
tice-based research also proﬁts academia by helping educators and researchers
stay current with the latest trends and developments in the ﬁeld. This results in
the development of more relevant and eﬀective journalism curricula (Niblock
2007; 2012; Robie 2015).
In designing the methodology of this study, we chose to conduct practice-based
research by collaborating with the Norwegian Association for Investigative Journalism
(Skup.No n.d.). SKUP is a non-proﬁt organization that promotes investigative journalism
in Norway. Together with SKUP, we published a call in May 2021 inviting investigative
journalists to submit projects where we could assist using data science and AI
techniques.
By opening a public call, we allocate ﬁnancial resources to support academic staﬀ
dedicated to 4 projects for a period of 6 months. We encouraged all the Norwegian
newsrooms to submit a project proposal and a committee of both AI and Journalism
academics was appointed to select the 3 best ones. By doing so we encourage Norwe-
gian newsrooms to explore avenues with which they are not familiar and that in
normal circumstances they would have not pursued We received several applications
and for the three selected projects, we dedicated an Associate Professor of Artiﬁcial
Intelligence. Each team was then composed of one academic from OsloMet, one Inves-
tigative Journalist daily collaborating with the AI expert, and a staﬀof supporting
journalists.
In our research approach, the investigative journalists were responsible for deciding
the topic, ﬁnding the initial data sources, formulating the research questions, and inter-
preting the results. The teams had variable compositions in terms of the number of jour-
nalists and experience with data handling. A smaller team of data journalists assisted with
data-related issues. Regular meetings ensured alignment between the data-focused
teams and the journalists. This collaborative approach enabled a targeted use of data
science and AI techniques in investigative journalism.
In 2022, we again selected three new projects and provided similar support.
The collaboration with SKUP not only provided access to experienced investigative
journalists but also ensured that the research had a direct impact on the ﬁeld.
The insights drawn from applying data science and AI techniques to investigative jour-
nalistic questions form the backbone of the present study. The journalistic results were
published in various outlets. Here, we have anonymized identities to maintain conﬁdenti-
ality. Team meetings and Discord channels were utilized to ensure eﬃcient collaboration
among stakeholders. Group meetings were held to identify signiﬁcant learning experi-
ences and analyse ﬁndings considering the existing literature. For the purpose of this
article, we draw on notes and discussions in team meetings and on Discord channel to
reconstruct the research processes.

 Description of Projects
Project 1
Exploration reimbursement scheme in the petroleum industry. The main goal of this
project was to bring attention to the exploration reimbursement tax scheme in the pet-
roleum industry. The journalists proposed to investigate and combine two publicly avail-
able data sources: the Petroleum Tax Lists (The Norwegian Tax Administration 2020) and
the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) Fact pages (NPD Fact Pages n.d.). The goal of
the project was to better understand how companies were accessing and using the
exploration reimbursement scheme, which has been in place since 2005. Additionally,
the project aimed to provide some oversight to the program by mapping oil exploration
activities, documented in the NPD fact pages, to the reimbursement claims in annual
taxes. In the process of this investigation, the idea emerged to deploy graph databases
to represent connections between petroleum companies, reimbursement payments
and drilling licenses.
Project 2
Adverse events in elderly care. The main goal of this project was to better understand how
the quality of elderly care varies across municipalities. The journalists proposed to corre-
late publicly available data recording “non-conformity reports” (NCR) and statistics from
SSB. NCR are gathered at the municipality level and are regulated by the government
guidelines “Norsk kodeverk for uønskede pasienthendelser” (Helsedirektoratet 2021).
The statistics available from SSB describe a wide set of municipality parameters. By corre-
lating these datasets, the project aimed to identify critical factors that contribute to the
occurrence of adverse events in elderly care.
Project 3
Eating disorders in professional skiers. The main goal of this project was to investigate the
occurrence of eating disorders among top athletes. The journalists proposed an innova-
tive approach to solve this problem by using computer vision. The core idea was to take
advantage of the mediatic exposure of the athletes. By collecting public images of the
athletes over time it is possible to infer the body mass index and body fat percentage
and consequently investigate drastic changes over the years.
Project 4
Media landscape analysis. The main goal of this project was to better understand
the Norwegian media landscape. The project started with an exploratory data analy-
sis of a dataset of Norwegian news and blog stories. The dataset collected infor-
mation about the article itself, including title, publisher, authors, and links, as well
as information about its social media engagement. In addition to exploratory analy-
sis, this project grew to track how stories move across both traditional and social
media.

 Results
In the ﬁeld of data journalism, the deployment of machine learning (ML) and artiﬁcial
intelligence (AI) algorithms requires a thorough understanding of the necessary data
and the feasibility of obtaining and processing that data. Based on existing literature,
we expected this process to be time-consuming – particularly in investigative journal-
ism projects where there is signiﬁcant complexity in both the questions and societal
structures involved. However, as we experienced, one should carefully consider the
quality and availability of the required data to correctly estimate the feasibility of the
project and its potential outcomes. It is crucial to note that input data of poor
quality will result in equally poor output, regardless of the algorithm’s computational
power.
We found similar diﬃculties and challenges across all of three projects, which we could
broadly categorize using the concepts introduced by Stray (Stray 2019b) as follows:
.
Data availability: Data relevant to a story may not be publicly accessible, data collection
results to be challenging, or the available dataset is incomplete/scattered
.
Data quality: Journalistic inference requires high-accuracy data
.
Newsworthiness: The concept of “newsworthy” is diﬃcult to encode computationally
Data Collection is a Critical Aspect of AI in Journalism
We found that the availability of data was a recurring challenge across all projects. Despite
identifying data sources before the project’s start and therefore expecting that data was
readily accessible, each project encountered diﬃculties in obtaining the necessary data.
The project exploring the reimbursement scheme in the petroleum industry stumbled
across a lack of consistent historical records. Despite the presence of publicly available
data from sources such as the Brønnøysund registry (brreg.no n.d.), historical data for
defunct companies was often missing. This required the purchase of data or the use of
alternative methods for collection. This project also suﬀered from a lack of transparent
data from the side of the tax authorities. While the oil exploration reimbursement
amounts are ostensibly available and published every year by the Norwegian Tax
Oﬃce, these reimbursements are not split between exploration and termination reimbur-
sements. The Norwegian Tax Oﬃce refused to release this information on request,
without which it is impossible to evaluate the success or failure of the exploration reim-
bursement policy. Moreover, the life cycle of a company can be complex and involves
merges and splits, takeovers and name changes. This makes it complicated to track
licenses and understand ﬁnancial ﬂows over time. Petroleum extraction licenses are typi-
cally shared between several companies in alliances that might also change over time. It is
consequently very diﬃcult to reconstruct the timeline of company history and reimburse-
ments without support from experts.
The project which sought to investigate the quality of elderly care in Norway also
encountered challenges in obtaining data. Despite the requirement for municipalities
to keep detailed records of non-conformity reports (NCR) in the elderly care sector, a com-
prehensive analysis of these reports had never been conducted. We discovered that often
the data was missing, unstructured or in hard-to-access formats. There were diﬀerent
JOURNALISM PRACTICE
7
 reasons for this, ranging from a lack of human resources in the municipality to a lack of
digital reporting systems. Privacy issues also prevented data sharing in the case of
small municipalities. Even when the municipality invested signiﬁcant resources to
collect and anonymize the records, the data analysis was not trivial due to the lack of stan-
dardization across municipalities. In the best-case scenario, municipalities sent their data
in the shape of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. This required extensive eﬀort from the team
to restructure the data in a standard format and sometimes led to data loss. Other muni-
cipalities delivered data in unstructured formats such as PDFs, Word ﬁles or just printed
out on A4 paper, leading to additional challenges wrangling the data into a usable
format. At a later stage, the project intended to correlate the NCR statistics with publicly
available data from the Norwegian Central Bureau of Statistics (SSB) (Statistisk sentralbyrå
2023) to better understand factors contributing to adverse events in elderly care facilities.
SSB maintains updated statistics of many societal parameters; however, historical analysis
of the data was challenging given the complex and frequent changes to the structure of
Norwegian municipalities. Upon request, SSB supported our investigation by allowing our
team to purchase restructured datasets, but these datasets were not provided freely
through their platform. Since then, they have integrated our proposed indexing of the
data in their report system for current and future data. This example shows how the struc-
ture and shareability of the data improved through the interaction between journalists
and data collectors.
These experiences highlight the need for increased transparency and accessibility of
data, particularly regarding business and healthcare. The lack of labeled data when
looking for suspicious activity and the unstructured nature of business annual reports
also presented signiﬁcant obstacles in utilizing AI and ML algorithms. Considering
these challenges, it is crucial to consider the feasibility of obtaining a complete and
high-quality dataset before embarking on investigative journalism projects that involve
data analysis.
Journalism would Beneﬁt from Greater Transparency in Company Structure
In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the need for greater transparency
in the ﬁnancial ﬂows of companies, particularly in the extractive and ﬁnancial sectors (Sti-
glitz 2002). This is because these sectors are often characterized by complex and opaque
ownership structures (Sachs and Warner 2001). One of the main challenges in uncovering
these ﬁnancial ﬂows is the lack of comprehensive and publicly available data on company
ownership and beneﬁcial ownership (Cobham and Janský 2020). While some countries
have made progress in this area, for example by joining the Extractive Industries Transpar-
ency Initiative (EITI) (Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative n.d.), many countries still
lack comprehensive and publicly available registers.
Additionally, even when data is publicly available, it is often unstructured, on paper
and in a customized format, which makes it challenging to extract information even
with state-of-the-art Object Character Recognition (OCR) algorithms. Furthermore, in
some cases, the companies themselves may be unwilling to disclose information about
their ownership and ﬁnancial ﬂows, making it diﬃcult for investigative journalists to
access the necessary data (Making Transparency Possible 2019). Even when a company
is willing to disclose information, it might be diﬃcult to access it as datasets might be
8

 scattered across multiple platforms and in multiple countries, not to mention privacy
legislations limiting data access (EU Court of Justice Delivers Blow to Beneﬁcial Owner-
ship … 2022).
While investigating the reimbursement scheme in the Norwegian petroleum industry
we experienced how complex and opaque ownership structures are. This is a particularly
illustrative example given that Norway, as a member of EITI, commits to disclose infor-
mation regarding the extractive (Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative n.d.).
There are numerous reasons why investigative journalists, and the news media, might
want to investigate complex and opaque ownership structures in the extractive and
ﬁnancial sectors. First, opaque ownership structure makes it diﬃcult to hold companies
accountable for their actions, especially when it comes to taxes and royalties for the
resources they extract. Several studies suggest that investigative journalism, and other
forms of transparency-promoting activities, can play a critical role in exposing complex
and opaque ownership structures in the extractive and ﬁnancial sectors (Beckett 2019;
Radon and Achuthan 2017). Based on our research, we believe data journalism in this
ﬁeld depends on initiatives such as OpenCorporates (OpenCorporates :: The Open Data-
base Of The Corporate World n.d.) and OpenOwnership (Open Ownership n.d.) to
move the ﬁeld forward. These and other organizations are taking the lead in utilizing
advanced Machine Learning and Graph Databases to analyse complex company struc-
tures and beneﬁcial ownership.
Information is Often not Publicly Accessible
In the case of the investigation of accidents in elderly care, Norwegian municipalities are
obliged to provide data to journalists. However, a signiﬁcant number of municipalities did
not provide the requested information. Various factors can inﬂuence whether municipa-
lities provide requested information to journalists or not. However, as the context can vary
from country to country and region to region, it is important to consider the speciﬁc cir-
cumstances and legal framework of each inquiry. Among the municipalities that did not
provide the data in our investigation, the main reasons cited were a lack of digital records,
on-going lawsuits that prevented the sharing of data and insuﬃcient human resources to
anonymize the data for privacy reasons. In addition, some municipalities simply failed to
respond to the journalist’s requests.
Additionally, there were also challenges in obtaining data from SSB (Statistisk sentral-
byrå 2023) due to the frequent rearrangements of municipalities by the government. Fre-
quent re-organization of municipalities leads to several challenges in terms of data
analysis (Kommunereformen 2020, 2021). Administrative boundary changes can impact
data quality, as data collection and reporting procedures may change, resulting in incon-
sistent or inaccurate data. This makes it diﬃcult to conduct accurate and reliable analyses
of parameters over the years.
In the project employing computer vision for BMI estimation, we negotiated with other
researchers to share their datasets, some of which had been scraped from public sources
like Reddit. While at ﬁrst glance there were multiple approaches, public and shared data-
sets available, we quickly realized that these were not suﬃcient for the uses of the project.
It is therefore important to highlight that it’s not only the quantity of data that is crucial,
but also their relevance to the research question.
JOURNALISM PRACTICE
9
 Given the challenges of limited access to data, it is likely that journalists will need to
invest signiﬁcant resources to obtain the necessary data, as demonstrated by the
examples presented in this article. Strategies such as collaborating with organizations
or individuals who have access to relevant data sets, using publicly available data
sources, or using alternative data sources can help obtain relevant datasets.
Journalistic Inference Requires Very High Accuracy
In the context of our practice-based research, it became clear that the process of journal-
istic inference demands high accuracy. Machine learning algorithms have been devel-
oped to identify patterns and common characteristics within datasets. However, when
it comes to investigative journalism, particularly in the realm of fraud detection, the
goal is to uncover the unusual, events that were not expected to occur. These subtle vari-
ations are crucial to consider, as they do not align with the primary purpose for which ML
and AI algorithms were developed.
Deﬁning what constitutes suspicious or unethical practices within the available
datasets is a diﬃcult task, due to obscure business practices and opaqueness in the
law and interpretation of it. This is perhaps unsurprising, as even cases with extensive
evidence have been ruled legal by the courts (Skattemotiverte transaksjoner – opplys-
ningsplikt og fradragsrett 2020). More fundamentally, even deﬁning what is a
“company” over the years within a landscape of multiple organizations and leadership
structures can be prohibitively complex, as we described in the previous chapter. This
makes it precarious to associate any company or private entity with an accusation of
misconduct.
Our research on the care of the elderly highlighted the diﬃculty in categorizing
events into diﬀerent classes. After evaluating multiple language models, we determined
that accurate quantiﬁcation of all categories could not be guaranteed. Thus, we decided
to focus solely on adverse events related to medicine, which were successfully classiﬁed.
It is important to note that we were not investigating causality in this project, but rather
exploring correlations between variables, which can provide insight into relevant vari-
ables for optimizing the services oﬀered by the municipality. Although it was not poss-
ible to quantify issues and problems related to elderly care within this landscape, our
research aimed to guide the journalist’s investigation towards addressing these issues,
supported by data when the administration or leaders of the municipality were
questioned.
A ﬁnal aspect worth mentioning is the variation in data reporting among municipali-
ties. Our analysis of collected databases revealed that each municipality, depending on
its size and structure, may report data on ﬁnances and human resources with varying
degrees of resolution. This makes the analysis process signiﬁcantly more challenging,
as municipalities may report a single budget for their entire health department while
others may report individual budgets for diﬀerent health departments (home assistance,
hospitals, nursing homes, etc.), making comparisons diﬃcult.
In our study on eating disorders in sports, we ultimately had to abandon the model due
to insuﬃcient accuracy. This serves as a crucial example of why expertise in AI is impor-
tant. A team without suﬃcient knowledge of AI may not have been able to understand
that the model was unreliable and unsuitable for use.

 Finally, in the research we did with the fact-checking organization Faktisk.no we did
succeed in identifying certain claims that could be conﬁdently made and relayed,
mainly because they were of a generalized, descriptive and qualitative nature.
Discussion
Data Preparation Tasks
According to Stray (Stray 2019a), data preparation tasks represent a signiﬁcant opportu-
nity for AI to beneﬁt investigative journalism in the short term.
In the context of the petroleum exploration reimbursement investigation, we found
that linking databases and transforming into Graph databases can reveal connections
that were previously unknown, by identifying patterns and relationships within large
amounts of data. This enhances the ability to uncover hidden links between entities
and to build a comprehensive picture of the issue at hand.
In the care for the elderly project, we faced the challenge of merging information from
various data types, including excel sheets, pdf ﬁles, and printed papers. Our research indi-
cates that public bodies should play a role in standardizing data dissemination, similar to
the example set by VG during the COVID-19 pandemic, where the government was
weekly providing updated statistics to the media.
Finally, in our study with the fact-checking organization Faktisk.no, we discovered that
most of the “AI”, speciﬁcally unsupervised machine learning, was used in the pre-proces-
sing steps to cluster similar stories. This step greatly assisted in the later analysis, demon-
strating the potential for AI in improving the eﬃciency of investigative journalism.
Our research supports the ﬁndings of Stray that data preparation tasks are the area
where AI seems to have the most immediate impact on investigative journalism.
However, much research and development are still needed to fully realize the potential
of AI in this ﬁeld and to ensure its ethical and eﬀective application.
Cross-Database Record Linkage
The use of AI in investigative journalism presents signiﬁcant potential for cross-database
record linkage. The ability to link records across databases has the potential to greatly
reduce the time, eﬀort, and costs associated with many investigations while producing
more robust results.
Referential integrity across databases refers to the consistency of relationships
between records in diﬀerent databases. Ensuring referential integrity is important in
ensuring the accuracy of the information being analysed and can greatly assist in connect-
ing records that would have been diﬃcult to link otherwise. However, referential integrity
can be diﬃcult to achieve due to diﬀerences in keys and naming conventions across
databases.
In the context of investigative journalism, referential integrity is crucial when linking
records from various sources. For example, in the investigation of petroleum tax reimbur-
sements, linking tax data with petroleum discovery data can help to hold companies
accountable. However, in some cases we found that companies used diﬀerent organiz-
ation numbers for taxation and licensing purposes, which made linking records
JOURNALISM PRACTICE
11
 diﬃcult. Similarly, in the investigation of care for the elderly, referential integrity across
databases is essential to ensure that information is accurate and correctly linked.
Our practice-based research highlights the potential of AI in facilitating cross-database
record linkage, which could greatly enhance the eﬀectiveness of investigative journalism.
Using the Right Tools Saves Time and Money and Enhances the Results’ Quality
In our investigation, we identiﬁed a multitude of tools that can be adapted and leveraged
for the purpose of investigation. These tools, including Pandas (Pandas - Python Data
Analysis Library n.d.), Seaborn (Waskom 2021), Norwegian language models such as
NorBERT or NoTraM (Web64 2016/2023), zero-shot classiﬁcation (NbAiLab/Nb-Bert-Base-
Mnli Hugging Face 2023), Neo4j (Neo4j Graph Data Platform – The Leader in Graph Data-
bases n.d.), NetworkX (NetworkX — NetworkX Documentation n.d.), and HuggingFace
(Hugging Face – The AI Community Building the Future. n.d.), represent only a selection
of the numerous available options that can be utilized to fulﬁll speciﬁc needs. It is of
utmost importance to have a comprehensive understanding of recent advancements in
AI to make informed decisions when selecting the most appropriate tools and platforms
for a given investigation.
Pandas, a data analysis library in Python, provides eﬃcient storage and manipulation of
tabular data through its data structures. Seaborn, another Python library, oﬀers a high-
level interface for generating informative and visually appealing statistical graphics. NB-
NERT, a Norwegian language model for named entity recognition (NER), can be utilized
to identify named entities in text. Zero-shot classiﬁcation, a machine learning technique,
enables categorization of unseen categories without the need for any additional training
data. Neo4j is a graph database management system designed for the storage and query-
ing of complex networked data. NetworkX, a Python library, enables the creation, manipu-
lation, and analysis of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. Lastly,
HuggingFace is a natural language processing platform providing access to a wide range
of pre-trained language models, including NER models.
These tools can be employed in a variety of ways to support journalistic investigations.
They can be used to analyze data and generate visualizations to gain a deeper under-
standing of trends and patterns, identify named entities in text, categorize text, store
and query complex networked data, and access pre-trained language models for NER
tasks. In our research project, we invested signiﬁcant resources to support the four pro-
jects. Two associate professors were dedicated to the projects and worked almost full-
time. Three masters students also contributed to the work. Additionally, two other pro-
fessors provided support, including time spent on funding and administrative tasks. All
in all, we estimate that the total cost of the projects was close to $200,000.
The sizes of the projects varied greatly. Two of the projects were large-scale eﬀorts that
involved a substantial team of journalists and developers. At times, each team could
consist of over ten individuals. The cost related to data science and AI was a small
portion of the overall budget for the largest projects, estimated to be less than 10%.
On the other hand, one of the smaller projects had a signiﬁcantly higher proportion of
its budget allocated to data science and AI, approximately half of the total. However, it
should be noted that it is challenging to provide precise estimates as several journalists
and developers worked on multiple projects simultaneously.
12
M. FRIDMAN ET AL.
 The projects presented signiﬁcant challenges in terms of budgeting and resource allo-
cation. The extent of the data pre-processing required was unforeseen and caused unfore-
seen expenses. When evaluating the costs of investment in data science and AI, it is
important to weigh them against the potential beneﬁts. In one instance, having
machine learning experts working on the project prevented the publication of unreliable
results. In another instance, the potential beneﬁts could be measured in terms of improve-
ments to quality of life and longevity. While it is diﬃcult to determine the ﬁnancial returns
of these investigations to the news media, we believe that they hold great promise for
long-term beneﬁt to society.
Importantly, the advent of AI in the media industry is already changing the pro-
fessional proﬁle of the journalist, since they have to manage constantly developing tech-
nologies, an increasing amount of accessible data, fake news generation, and last but
not least, the ethical implications introduced by the use of AI in modern society
(Túñez-López, Fieiras-Ceide, and Vaz-Álvarez 2021). Therefore, appropriate training of
journalists, as well as a productive collaboration with experts in the ﬁelds of AI, is necess-
ary to allow them to automate repetitive tasks and to process large amount of data
eﬃciently so that they can focus on creating high-quality human-crafted journalism
(Noain-Sánchez 2022).
Conclusion
In this study, we applied an interdisciplinary approach to enhance investigative journal-
ism with advanced machine learning and data science techniques. We utilized a variety
of tools, including Pandas, Seaborn, Norwegian language models like NB-BERT, zero-
shot classiﬁcation, Neo4j, NetworkX, and HuggingFace to build applications that made
the investigative process more cost-eﬀective. During the course of this project, we
observed that the landscape of large language models and computer vision was
rapidly changing, with the release of four major neural networks in the latter half of
2022. This trend is likely to continue, with the speed of innovation and openness in the
ﬁeld leading to falling costs of investigative projects.
Based on our experiences, we believe that it is crucial to move beyond interdisciplinary
projects and towards true trans-disciplinary projects. “Trans-disciplinary” refers to a colla-
borative approach that integrates knowledge and skills from multiple disciplines to solve
complex problems and address real-world challenges. It diﬀers from interdisciplinary
teamwork in that it involves active participation and collaboration from all stakeholders
including those outside the ﬁeld of expertise, to ensure that the solutions produced
are holistic and relevant to the real-world context. Additionally, it requires participants
to develop joint theoretical and methodological frameworks to guide the teamwork.
In order to maximize the chances of success we have developed a recommended
workﬂow summarized in Figure 1. We recommend prioritizing projects with well-stated
research questions and a clear hypothesis, while also considering the potential value of
the database itself, even in the absence of a “smoking gun”. Moreover, it is important
to keep in mind that historical data can be missing, incomplete and diﬃcult to interpret,
therefore, we recommend focusing on projects based on recent or current time periods.
Happily, data are becoming increasingly available, thanks to the active contribution of
both private and public bodies, such that hopefully this restriction will diminish with
JOURNALISM PRACTICE
13
 time. Additionally, we suggest using explainable methods and visualization techniques
that are easily understandable to journalists, editors, and the general public.
In addition to the tangible outcomes of these projects in the form of news reports and
documentaries, we also gained valuable insights into the challenges and complexities of
these types of collaborations. We found that the investigations were more productive
when both journalists and AI specialists became literate in each other’s ﬁelds and

 engaged in a mutual learning process, as represented in Figure 2. This highlights the
importance of using existing algorithms, programs, and models, as well as developing
an understanding of the broader range of techniques in AI and data analysis.
Data journalism has emerged as an important ﬁeld in contemporary journalism. The
rise of big data, open data and data visualization technologies have enabled journalists
to leverage data in innovative ways to tell more compelling stories. Data journalism
oﬀers a new way of reporting that is grounded in the analysis of large data sets, and
that allows for the creation of new insights that would not be possible through traditional
reporting methods. In this paper, we explore the role of data journalism in contemporary
journalism and examine the ways in which it is transforming the ﬁeld of journalism.

The  habenula
 is  a brain
 region
 that  has  gained
 increasing
 popularity
 over  the  recent  years
 due  to
 its
role
 in  processing
 value-related
 and  experience-dependent
 information
 with  a strong
 link to depression,
addiction,
 sleep
 and  social  interactions.
 This  small  diencephalic
 nucleus
 is proposed
 to  act as  a  multimodal
hub
 or  a switchboard,
 where
 inputs
 from  different
 brain  regions  converge.
 These  diverse  inputs  to the
habenula
 carry  information
 about  the sensory
 world  and the  animal’s
 internal
 state,  such  as reward
expectation
 or  mood.
 However,
 it  is not  clear  how  these
 diverse
 habenular
 inputs  interact
 with  each
other
 and  how  such  interactions
 contribute
 to  the  function
 of  habenular
 circuits  in regulating
 behavioral
responses
 in various
 tasks  and
 contexts.
 In  this  review,
 we  aim  to  discuss
 how  information
 processing
 in
habenular
 circuits,
 can  contribute
 to  speciﬁc
 behavioral
 programs
 that  are  attributed  to  the  habenula.

The
 habenula
 (Hb)
 is
 an
 evolutionarily
 conserved
 diencephalic
nucleus,
 connecting
 forebrain
 regions
 such
 as
 prefrontal
 cortex
(PFC)
 [1], septohippocampal
 region
 [2]
 and
 the
 Basal
 Ganglia
[3–6], with
 downstream
 monoaminergic
 nuclei,
 such
 as
 the
 ven-
tral
 tegmental
 area/rostromedial
 tegmental
 nucleus
 (VTA/RMTg)
[7–13]
 and
 the
 Raphe
 nuclei
 [2,6,11,14–16], as
 well
 as
 the
 interpe-
duncular
 nucleus
 (IPN)
 [6]
 (Fig.
 1A,B).
Already
 in
 1914,
 experimental
 evidence
 highlighted
 the
 role
 of
the
 Hb
 in
 regulating
 the
 valence
 of
 behavioral
 outcomes.
 It
 was
observed
 that
 electrostimulation
 of
 habenular
 efferents,
 in
 chim-
panzees,
 induced
 a
 respiration
 pattern
 resembling
 laughter
 [17,18].
However,
 it
 was
 not
 until
 the
 eighties
 that
 researchers
 proposed
the
 idea
 of
 the
 Hb
 steering
 emotionally
 involved
 behavior
 by
 the
modulation
 of
 dopamine
 neurons
 [19]. With
 the
 reﬁnement
 of
experimental
 tools,
 as
 well
 as
 the
 advent
 of
 novel
 techniques
 such
as
 optogenetics
 and
 molecular
 tools,
 it
 became
 possible
 to
 investi-
gate
 and
 further
 subdivide
 the
 roles
 of
 the
 Hb
 in
 a
 broader
 range
of
 behaviors
 related
 to
 learning,
 depression,
 addiction,
 sleep
 and
social
 interactions.
The
 mammalian
 Hb
 consists
 of
 at
 least
 two
 functionally
 segre-
gated
 subnuclei:
 the
 medial
 (MHb)
 and
 the
 lateral
 habenula
 (LHb).
The
 MHb
 was
 suggested
 to
 play
 an
 important
 role
 in
 anxiety,
 fear,
depression
 and
 nicotine
 addiction
 [20–24]. Moreover,
 MHb
 activity
was
 shown
 to
 be
 regulated
 by
 circadian
 rhythm
 [25]. Yet,
 functional
studies
 of
 the
 MHb
 have
 been
 difﬁcult
 in
 mammals
 due
 to
 its
 small
volume
 and
 deep
 location
 right
 next
 to
 the
 third
 ventricle
 [26].
 On
the
 other
 hand,
 a
 lot
 more
 studies
 have
 investigated
 the
 role
 of
the
 LHb
 in
 brain
 function
 and
 animal
 behavior,
 with
 a
 strong
 focus
on
 regulation
 of
 dopaminergic
 and
 serotonergic
 nuclei
 in
 order
 to
shape
 both
 innate
 and
 conditioned
 behaviors
 [26].
Research
 on
 the
 Hb
 has
 been
 diverse,
 covering
 multiple
 ques-
tions
 ranging
 from
 the
 role
 of
 the
 Hb
 in
 learning
 and
 cognitive
function,
 to
 its
 involvement
 in
 mood
 disorders
 and
 addiction
 in
human
 patients.
 Moreover,
 the
 Hb
 has
 always
 been
 an
 attractive
brain
 region
 for
 those
 who
 are
 interested
 in
 studying
 the
 devel-
opment
 of
 brain
 asymmetries
 and
 their
 potential
 function.
 Finally,
an
 increasing
 amount
 of
 evidence
 suggests
 an
 important
 role
 for
the
 Hb
 in
 sensory
 information
 processing
 in
 several
 animal
 models.
While
 all
 these
 exciting
 results
 contributed
 to
 our
 understanding
 of
the
 habenular
 function
 in
 the
 brain,
 the
 link
 between
 these
 diverse
disciplines
 of
 habenular
 research
 is
 not
 yet
 fully
 established.
 In
 this
review,
 we
 aim
 to
 provide
 a
 broad
 overview
 of
 the
 research
 con-
ducted
 on
 the
 Hb
 and
 try
 to
 link
 these
 studies
 that
 cover
 different
disciplines
 of
 neuroscience.
In the
 following
 sections,
 we
 will
 ﬁrst
 provide
 an
 overview
 of
the
 inputs
 and
 outputs
 of
 the
 habenular
 circuitry
 and
 the
 role
 of
these
 structures
 in
 different
 behaviors.
 Next,
 we
 will
 describe
 how
sensory
 information
 is
 received
 and
 processed
 in
 the
 Hb.
 We  then
suggest
 several
 hypotheses
 about
 how
 neural
 information
 from
different
 brain
 regions
 can
 be
 integrated
 at
 the
 level
 of
 the
 Hb.
We
 propose
 that
 the
 ongoing
 activity
 observed
 in
 the
 Hb,
 plays
 an
important
 role
 in
 reﬂecting
 the
 internal
 state
 of
 the
 animal,
 inte-
grating
 information
 from
 a
 number
 of
 brain
 regions
 and
 the
 sensory
systems.

 The
 role
 of
 the
 habenula
 in
 generating
 complex
behaviors
1.1.
 Learning,
 encoding
 errors
 and
 negative
 outcomes
Seminal
 studies,
 using
 single-unit
 recordings
 in
 primates,
showed
 a
 direct
 involvement
 of
 the
 LHb
 in
 encoding
 prediction
error.
 One
 of
 these
 studies
 reported
 that
 several
 LHb
 neurons
 were
activated
 by
 no-reward
 predicting
 cues
 as
 well
 as
 the
 absence
 of
 the
reward,
 while
 they
 were
 inhibited
 by
 reward
 and
 reward
 predict-
ing
 stimuli
 [3]. The
 ﬁring
 rate
 of
 neurons
 inhibited
 by
 reward
 and
reward
 predicting
 cues,
 is
 also
 directly
 proportional
 to
 the
 proba-
bility
 of
 receiving
 the
 reward
 [27,28]. Moreover,
 the
 activity
 of
 LHb
neurons
 is
 shown
 to
 follow
 the
 activity
 of
 the
 dopaminergic
 neu-
rons
 in
 the
 substantia
 nigra
 pars
 compacta
 (SNc)
 in
 case
 of
 a
 reward
and
 to
 precede
 it
 in
 case
 of
 reward
 omission
 [3,29].
Rodent
 studies
 have
 further
 unraveled
 the
 complexity
 of
 this
interconnected
 circuit
 composed
 of
 feedback
 and
 feedforward
 sig-
naling
 between
 the
 LHb,
 the
 monoaminergic
 brainstem
 nuclei
 and
the
 basal
 ganglia.
 The
 LHb
 was
 shown
 to
 inhibit
 dopaminergic
 neu-
rons
 of
 the
 VTA
 indirectly
 via
 the
 RMTg
 [8,12,30–33]
 or
 directly
by
 exciting
 local
 GABAergic
 neurons
 in
 the
 VTA
 [12,34]. Exposure
to
 aversive
 stimuli
 such
 as
 foot
 shocks,
 induces
 plasticity
 in
 the
LHb-RMTg
 pathway
 [33]
 but
 also
 results
 in
 an
 increased
 ﬁring
 in
the
 GABAergic
 population
 of
 the
 VTA
 [35]. Stimulating
 LHb
 neu-
rons
 directly
 induces
 place
 avoidance,
 a
 behavior
 characterized
 by
reduced
 exploration
 of
 the
 stimulation-coupled
 area
 [35–37].
 In
addition,
 the
 role
 of
 the
 LHb
 has
 also
 been
 investigated
 in
 terms
of
 cost-beneﬁt
 decision
 making.
 Rats
 learnt
 to
 receive
 a
 greater
beneﬁt
 (four
 food
 pellets
 instead
 of
 one)
 when
 their
 waiting
 time
was
 increased.
 When
 the
 probability
 of
 receiving
 the
 award
 was
low,
 the
 cost
 of
 waiting
 became
 too
 high.
 Lesioning
 the
 LHb
 dis-
abled
 the
 rats
 from
 making
 such
 cost-efﬁcient
 decisions,
 without
affecting
 the
 animal’s
 ability
 to
 evaluate
 the
 magnitude
 of
 the
immediate
 reward
 [32]. While
 VTA
 receives
 information
 directly
or
 indirectly
 from
 LHb,
 it
 also
 sends
 feedback
 projections
 inhibit-
ing
 LHb
 neurons
 [8]. Investigation
 of
 these
 projections
 reveals
 a
co-release
 of
 glutamate
 and
 GABA
 [7,38], which
 suggests
 that
 mod-
ulating
 the
 co-release
 ratio
 can
 be
 a
 potential
 mechanism
 of
 tuning
habenular
 activity.
 Interestingly,
 recordings
 of
 VTA
 neurons
 show
two
 different
 populations
 encoding
 aversive
 and
 rewarding
 stim-
uli
 with
 different
 dynamics.
 The
 authors
 showed
 that,
 while
 most
GABAergic
 VTA
 neurons
 respond
 to
 aversive
 stimuli,
 the
 majority
 of
dopaminergic
 neurons
 respond
 to
 reward
 related
 information
 [39].
These
 results
 indicate
 that
 the
 LHb
 modulates
 and
 is
 modulated
 by
the
 VTA,
 which
 plays
 a
 role
 in
 dopaminergic
 regulation
 of
 animal
behavior.
 In
 addition
 to
 modulating
 dopaminergic
 signaling,
 the
Hb
 was
 also
 shown
 to
 regulate
 serotonin
 release
 directly
 through
LHb
 projections
 to
 the
 Raphe
 nuclei
 [32,40–42]
 and
 indirectly
 via
the
 projections
 of
 the
 LHb
 and
 the
 MHb
 to
 the
 RMTg
 [16]
 and
 the
IPN
 [42]
 respectively.
 The
 role
 of
 serotonin
 in
 reward
 processing
and
 learning
 is
 still
 under
 investigation.
 However,
 accumulating
evidence
 supports
 its
 involvement
 in
 these
 phenomena
 [43–47].
Taken
 together,
 these
 ﬁndings
 suggests
 that
 both
 dopamine
 and
serotonin
 modulate
 the
 processing
 of
 stimulus-related
 information
bidirectionally,
 shaping
 it
 based
 on
 the
 internal
 state
 of
 the
 animal
in
 order
 to
 tune
 subsequent
 behavioral
 outcomes.
The
 mammalian
 lateral
 and
 medial
 Hb
 ﬁnd
 their
 respective
homologues
 as
 the
 ventral
 habenula
 (vHb)
 and
 the
 dorsal
 habenula
(dHb)
 in
 zebraﬁsh
 (Fig.
 1C)
 [4,6]. Lesioning
 the
 dHb,
 was
 shown
to
 prevent
 zebraﬁsh
 from
 coping
 with
 threats
 in
 a
 stressful
 context
and
 induces
 freezing
 (or
 helplessness),
 rather
 than
 escape
 or
 avoid-
ance
 [48,49].
 A
 complementary
 study
 [6]
 further
 showed
 that
 a
population
 of
 vHb
 neurons
 encodes
 the
 negative
 expectation
 value
that
 is
 associated
 with
 the
 conditioned
 stimulus,
 by
 increasing
 their
tonic
 response
 to
 the
 conditioned
 stimulus
 during
 learning.
 In
 addi-
tion,
 the
 phasically
 active
 vHb
 neurons
 represent
 the
 prediction
error.
 Along
 with
 this,
 the
 same
 study
 showed
 that
 lesioning
 the
vHb
 impairs
 the
 ability
 of
 the
 ﬁsh
 to
 perform
 active
 avoidance,
without
 affecting
 the
 switch
 from
 freezing
 to
 agitation
 as
 is
 the
case
 for
 the
 dHb
 ablation.
 These
 results
 are
 in
 line
 with
 the
 two-
factor
 theory
 of
 active
 avoidance.
 At
 ﬁrst,
 an
 aversive
 stimulus
 is
associated
 with
 a
 biologically
 neutral
 stimulus,
 resulting
 in
 a
 fear
response
 when
 the
 neutral
 stimulus
 is
 presented
 (Pavlovian
 factor,
association
 phase).
 Subsequently,
 the
 transition
 from
 an
 unsafe
 to
a
 safe
 state
 can
 then
 be
 further
 associated
 to
 a
 speciﬁc
 performed

1.2.
 Addiction
In
 addition
 to
 the
 extensive
 literature
 linking
 the
 Hb
 to
 learned
behaviors,
 the
 Hb
 is
 gaining
 popularity
 and
 receives
 increasing
clinical
 interest,
 as
 a
 number
 of
 studies
 in
 humans
 [52]
 and
rodents
 [52]
 have
 shown
 its
 involvement
 in
 addiction
 [53–55]
to
 nicotine
 [55–59], cocaine
 [60,61]
 and
 ethanol
 [62]. The
 Hb-
IPN
 pathway
 is
 particularly
 enriched
 with
 nicotinic
 acetylcholine
receptors
 (nAChRs)
 [57,59,63,64]. In
 human
 studies,
 small
 changes
in
 the
 genes
 encoding
 different
 subunits
 of
 these
 receptors,
 were
linked
 to
 a
 predisposition
 to
 nicotine
 addiction
 [52].
 In
 a
 rodent
model,
 high
 doses
 of
 nicotine
 were
 shown
 to
 facilitate
 LHb
 exci-
tation,
 by
 activating
 6-nAChRs,
 while
 low
 doses
 inhibit
 the
 LHb
via
 42-nAChRs
 [65]. This
 dose-dependent
 effect
 of
 nicotine
 is
also
 reﬂected
 in
 the
 behavior
 of
 the
 animal,
 since
 low
 doses
 of
nicotine
 induce
 conditioned
 place
 preference
 [66]
 while
 high
 doses
can
 induce
 place
 avoidance
 [59,67,68]. Moreover,
 nicotine
 has
 an
excitatory
 inﬂuence
 on
 the
 activity
 of
 dopaminergic
 neurons,
 pre-
dominantly
 in
 the
 posterior
 VTA
 [69].
 Similar
 behavioral
 effects
are
 observed
 with
 ethanol,
 where
 low
 doses
 induce
 conditioned
place
 aversion
 while
 higher
 doses
 induce
 place
 preference
 [62].
However,
 it
 is
 not
 clear
 if
 and
 how
 this
 dose-dependent
 behav-
ioral
 switch
 is
 mediated
 by
 the
 Hb.
 It
 was
 suggested
 that
 the
activation
 of
 dopaminergic
 neurons
 in
 the
 VTA,
 by
 high
 doses
 of
ethanol,
 might
 counterbalance
 the
 aversion
 effect
 driven
 by
 the
LHb
 [62]. In
 line
 with
 these
 results,
 cocaine
 self-administration
 was
shown
 to
 increase
 LHb
 neuron
 excitability
 [61]. Moreover,
 cocaine
withdrawal
 changes
 the
 GABA\Glutamate
 co-release
 ratio
 in
 the
pathway
 between
 the
 entopeduncular
 nucleus
 and
 the
 LHb,
 result-
ing
 in
 a
 disinhibition
 of
 the
 LHb,
 which
 could
 potentially
 lead
 to
 a
depressive-like
 state
 [5]. Interestingly,
 deep
 brain
 stimulation
 of
the
 LHb
 was
 shown
 to
 reduce
 cocaine
 intake
 in
 rats,
 as
 well
 as
cocaine
 and
 cocaine-cue
 related
 c-fos
 expression
 in
 the
 LHb
 [70],
suggesting
 that
 the
 LHb
 could
 be
 an
 interesting
 target
 for
 amelio-
rating
 the
 behavioral
 symptoms
 of
 addiction.
1.3.
 Mood
 disorders
 and
 social
 behaviors
Since
 habenular
 circuits
 are
 involved
 in
 encoding
 prediction
errors,
 coping
 with
 stress
 as
 well
 as
 controlling
 the
 activity
 of
dopaminergic
 and
 serotonergic
 brain
 nuclei,
 it
 is
 not
 surprising
that
 habenular
 dysfunction
 is
 associated
 with
 several
 mood
 dis-
orders,
 ranging
 from
 anxiety
 [71]
 to
 depression
 [52]. Patients
suffering
 from
 major
 depressive
 disorder
 were
 shown
 to
 have
 an
altered
 habenular
 volume
 [72,73]
 and
 baseline
 activity
 [40,74].
More
 speciﬁcally,
 during
 a
 passive
 conditioning
 task
 where
 an
 ini-
tially
 neutral
 cue
 is
 associated
 with
 a
 negative
 stimulus
 (an
 electric
shock),
 healthy
 participants
 show
 an
 increased
 cue-evoked
 activ-
ity
 in
 the
 Hb.
 Depressive
 patients
 however,
 show
 a
 decrease
 in
habenular
 activity
 as
 the
 cue-stimulus
 association
 strengthens
 [75].
Excitingly,
 deep
 brain
 stimulation
 of
 the
 Hb
 was
 linked
 to
 reduced
symptoms
 of
 depression
 in
 a
 human
 patient
 [76], which
 opens
 a
range
 of
 therapeutic
 treatments
 for
 depression
 by
 interfering
 with
habenular
 activity.
Despite
 these
 exciting
 results
 in
 humans,
 the
 neural
 mecha-
nisms
 underlying
 the
 role
 of
 habenular
 circuits
 in
 mood
 disorders
are
 still
 not
 fully
 understood.

 dopaminergic
 neurons

 based
 on
 chronic
 mild
 stress
 (CMS)
 [77]. Fur-
ther
 investigation
 identiﬁed
 two
 potential
 drivers
 for
 this
 activity
decrease
 in
 the
 VTA,
 the
 LHb
 and
 the
 infralimbic
 prefrontal
 cor-
tex
 (ILPFC).
 While
 both
 the
 LHb
 and
 the
 ILPFC
 inhibit
 dopaminergic
neurons
 in
 the
 VTA,
 the
 LHb
 preferentially
 inhibits
 the
 lateral
 VTA
instead
 of
 the
 medial
 VTA
 [77].
 This
 study
 therefore
 questions
 the
involvement
 of
 the
 Hb
 in
 the
 modulation
 of
 dopaminergic
 neurons
linked
 to
 the
 effects
 of
 CMS.
 However,
 parallel
 investigations
 show
 a
direct
 link
 between
 habenular
 hyperactivity
 and
 a
 depression-like
phenotype
 [78,79]. Interestingly,
 inhibiting
 glial
 glutamate
 reup-
take
 in
 the
 LHb
 induces
 an
 increase
 in
 neural
 ﬁring
 rate
 and
 c-fos
expression,
 which
 again
 resulted
 in
 depressive-like
 symptoms
 [80].
A
 recent
 study
 in
 zebraﬁsh,
 using
 another
 paradigm
 of
 inducing
stress
 by
 social
 conﬂict,
 reveals
 a
 direct
 role
 of
 the
 dHb
 in
 regu-
lating
 animal
 behavior.
 After
 a
 ﬁght
 between
 two
 ﬁsh,
 local
 ﬁeld
potential
 recordings
 in
 the
 IPN
 showed
 that
 loser
 ﬁsh
 have
 reduced
transmission
 in
 the
 pathway
 between
 the
 lateral
 dHb
 and
 the
 dor-
sal/intermediate
 IPN
 [81]. Complementary
 studies
 in
 rodents
 also
report
 that
 social
 isolation
 can
 induce
 c-fos
 expression
 in
 the
 MHb.
This
 effect
 could
 further
 be
 rescued
 by
 increasing
 the
 social
 inter-
action
 between
 animals
 [82,83].
Based
 on
 these
 ﬁndings
 Hb
 appears
 to
 have
 several
 roles
 in
 con-
trolling
 mood
 and
 social
 interactions,
 which
 are
 tightly
 linked
 to
one
 another.
 It
 is
 however
 not
 yet
 clear
 how
 neuronal
 signals
 are
processed
 by
 the
 Hb
 and
 how
 they
 relate
 to
 controlling
 mood
 and
social
 interactions
 in
 healthy
 individuals,
 as
 well
 as
 those
 who
 are
suffering
 from
 major
 depressive
 disorder.
2.
 Sensory
 representations
 in
 the
 habenula
Several
 studies
 showed
 that
 a
 diverse
 range
 of
 sensory
 modal-
ities
 can
 evoke
 robust
 responses
 in
 the
 non-mammalian
 Hb
[14,84,85]. On
 the
 contrary,
 only
 a
 smaller
 number
 of
 works
 on
 the
mammalian
 Hb
 report
 such
 sensory
 responses
 [86,87]. To
 gain
 more
insight
 into
 the
 role
 of
 sensory
 processing
 in
 the
 Hb,
 a
 more
 thor-
ough
 comparative
 approach
 is
 needed.
 Below
 we  discuss
 different
sensory
 modalities
 that
 are
 shown
 to
 be
 processed
 by
 habenular
circuits
 in
 a
 diverse
 range
 of
 animal
 models.
2.1.
 Electroreception
 and
 vestibular
 system
Functional
 measurements
 of
 the
 MHb
 homologue
 in
 lampreys,
showed
 that
 exposing
 lampreys
 to
 electric
 ﬁelds
 increases
 the
activity
 of
 Hb
 neurons
 and
 can
 initiate
 responses
 that
 are
 typical
 for
ﬂight
 and
 freezing
 behavior
 [88].
 Most
 likely,
 this
 information
 from
the
 electroreceptive
 organ
 is
 transferred
 indirectly
 to
 the
 Hb
 via
the
 pretectum.
 Retrograde
 tracing
 in
 the
 Hb
 indeed
 showed
 direct
projections
 from
 the
 pretectum,
 while
 retrograde
 tracing
 in
 the
 pre-
tectum
 itself
 showed
 direct
 projections
 from
 the
 electroreceptive
organ
 [14].
2.2.
 Olfaction
Anatomical
 tracing
 studies
 in
 lampreys
 also
 demonstrated
direct
 projections
 from
 the
 medial
 olfactory
 bulb
 (OB)
 to
 the
 MHb
homologue
 [14]. Odor
 stimulation
 of
 these
 medial
 OB
 neurons
 was
shown
 to
 activate
 spinal
 locomotor
 networks
 in
 lampreys
 [89],
which
 suggests
 a
 potential
 link
 between
 MHb
 projecting
 OB  neu-
rons
 and
 the
 initiation
 of
 fast
 motor
 behaviors.
 Such
 characteristic
movements
 that
 are
 tightly
 linked
 to
 odor
 cues
 are
 not
 only
 lim-
ited
 to
 lampreys,
 but
 were
 also
 observed
 in
 newborn
 rats,
 dogs,
mice
 and
 zebraﬁsh
 [90–93]. In
 line
 with
 studies
 in
 lampreys,
 trac-
ing
 studies
 in
 salamanders
 and
 in
 zebraﬁsh
 further
 conﬁrmed
 the
direct
 relay
 of
 olfactory
 information
 from
 OB  to
 the
 MHb
 homo-
logue
 [94,95]. Interestingly,
 it
 was
 also
 shown
 that
 zebraﬁsh
 mitral
cells
 from
 the
 mediodorsal
 OB
 send
 projections
 preferentially
 to
 the
right
 dHb,
 the
 MHb
 homologue
 in
 zebraﬁsh
 [95]. In
 vivo
 recordings
further
 conﬁrmed
 that
 odor
 responses
 in
 the
 dHb
 are
 asymmet-
ric
 across
 the
 hemispheres
 with
 stronger
 odor
 responses
 in
 the
right
 dHb
 [84,96]
 (Fig.
 2a).
 However,
 it
 appears
 that
 while
 odor
identity
 is
 precisely
 encoded
 by
 differential
 activation
 of
 zebraﬁsh
OB
 neurons
 [97,98], odor
 responses
 of
 dHb
 neurons
 are
 less
 odor
speciﬁc
 and
 respond
 broadly
 to
 odors
 from
 different
 categories
[96]. Moreover,
 a
 complementary
 study
 showed
 that
 dHb
 and
 vHb
neurons
 display
 distinct
 temporal
 delays
 in
 response
 to
 different
odorant
 categories
 and
 concentrations
 [85]. These
 results
 suggest
that
 the
 non-mammalian
 Hb
 receives
 information
 from
 a
 distinct
part
 of
 the
 olfactory
 system
 and
 relays
 olfactory
 information
 onto
its
 downstream
 monoaminergic
 targets
 [84].
 It
 is
 worth
 to
 note
 that
despite
 this
 extensive
 work
 in
 the
 non-mammalian
 Hb,
 it
 remains
unclear
 whether
 olfactory
 inputs
 are
 conserved
 in
 the
 mammalian

Hb.
 Further
 studies
 are
 needed
 to
 reveal
 whether
 the
 Hb
 receives
olfactory
 information
 from
 the
 piriform
 cortex
 [99]
 or
 other
 parts
of
 the
 higher
 olfactory
 system
 [95,100]
 and
 what
 role
 the
 Hb
 plays
in
 olfactory
 processing
 within
 the
 context
 of
 behavioral
 plasticity
and
 learning.
2.3.
 Photoreception
 and
 vision
The
 parapineal
 (Pp)
 is
 a
 sensory
 organ
 that
 contains
 photorecep-
tors
 conveying
 information
 about
 the
 ambient
 illumination
 to
 the
brain
 and
 is
 thought
 to
 be
 involved
 in
 circadian
 rhythms
 [101–104].
This
 brain
 region
 is
 present
 in
 lampreys,
 bowﬁn,
 teleosts,
 reptiles
and
 birds,
 but
 it
 is
 absent
 in
 other
 vertebrate
 groups
 [105–108]. In
lampreys
 and
 in
 ﬁsh,
 the
 Pp
 projects
 asymmetrically
 to
 the
 left
 MHb
homologue
 [109–113]. The
 inﬂuence
 of
 the
 Pp
 on
 the
 Hb
 was
 shown
to
 contribute
 to
 asymmetries
 in
 gene
 expression,
 development
 and
function
 between
 the
 left
 and
 the
 right
 dHb
 [84,114]. However,
 it
 is
still
 unclear
 whether
 the
 Pp
 relays
 any
 information
 about
 ambient
light
 conditions
 to
 Hb
 neurons
 or
 whether
 it
 is
 merely
 a
 regulator
 in
habenular
 development.
 The
 ﬁrst
 functional
 investigation
 of
 visual
responses
 in
 the
 zebraﬁsh
 dHb
 suggests
 that
 the
 majority
 (if
 not
 all)
of
 the
 visual
 responses
 in
 the
 dHb
 do
 not
 arise
 from
 the
 Pp
 but
 likely
from
 the
 retina
 [84]. Indeed,
 the
 authors
 showed
 that
 eye
 removal
abolished
 all
 dHb
 visual
 responses,
 but
 laser
 ablation
 of
 the
 Pp
 did
not
 have
 a
 signiﬁcant
 effect
 on
 the
 dHb
 visual
 responses.
Intriguingly,
 dHb
 light
 responses,
 like
 odor
 responses,
 are
 asym-
metric
 across
 habenular
 hemispheres
 [84].
 Visual
 responses
 are
more
 prominent
 on
 the
 left
 dHb
 while
 odor
 responses
 are
 pre-
dominantly
 observed
 in
 the
 right
 dHb
 (Fig.
 2A).
 The
 asymmetric
segregation
 of
 sensory
 modalities
 is
 also
 preserved
 in
 the
 dorsoven-
tral
 organization
 of
 the
 Hb
 axonal
 targets
 in
 the
 IPN,
 which
highlights
 the
 importance
 of
 sensory
 segregation
 in
 the
 Hb
 for
information
 processing
 and
 controlling
 animal
 behavior.
 While
 the
function
 of
 the
 dorsoventral
 segregation
 of
 visual
 and
 olfactory
information
 in
 the
 IPN
 is
 not
 yet
 clear,
 the
 left-right
 segregation
of
 sensory
 modalities
 in
 Hb
 suggests
 a
 division
 of
 labor
 across
the
 habenular
 hemispheres.
 This
 could
 in
 principle
 increase
 the
information
 processing
 capacity
 of
 the
 Hb,
 as
 distinct
 computa-
tions
 would
 be
 processed
 by
 a
 dedicated
 hemisphere
 rather
 than
being
 duplicated
 in
 an
 alternatively
 symmetric
 and
 redundant
 sys-
tem
 [115]. Several
 perturbations
 were
 also
 shown
 to
 interfere
 with
these
 functional
 asymmetries
 between
 habenular
 hemispheres
[84]. Such
 experimental
 manipulations
 could
 be
 used
 to
 further
 test
whether
 disrupted
 habenular
 asymmetry
 leads
 to
 impairments
 in
behavioral
 performance
 during
 visual,
 olfactory
 and
 mixed
 visio-
olfactory
 tasks.
In
 the
 meantime,
 recent
 studies
 in
 ﬁsh
 have
 linked
 the
 visual
responses
 in
 Hb
 to
 light-preference
 and
 circadian
 behaviors
[116,117]. Furthermore,
 it
 was
 shown
 that
 a
 subpopulation
 of
ON-responsive
 retinal
 ganglion
 cells
 activates
 the
 dorsal
 thalamic
nuclei,
 which
 in
 turn
 activate
 and
 inhibit
 different
 populations
 of
the
 left
 dHb
 neurons
 with
 complex
 temporal
 response
 patterns
 in
a
 light
 intensity
 dependent
 manner
 [116,118]. In
 line
 with
 the
 role
of
 the
 Hb
 in
 these
 observed
 behaviors,
 Hb
 lesions
 in
 quails
 were
shown
 to
 be
 effective
 in
 suppressing
 inhibitory
 inﬂuences
 of
 light
stimulation
 [119], suggesting
 the
 presence
 of
 visual
 processing,
 also
in
 the
 bird
 Hb.
Only
 a
 limited
 number
 of
 studies
 have
 investigated
 sensory
 pro-
cessing
 in
 the
 mammalian
 Hb
 [86,87]. While
 the
 Hb
 is
 located
deep
 inside
 the
 mammalian
 brain,
 light-evoked
 responses
 were
also
 reported
 in
 the
 rodent
 LHb
 and
 MHb
 [86]. In
 vivo
 recordings
 of
both
 habenular
 subnuclei
 displayed
 excitatory
 and
 inhibitory
 char-
acteristics
 in
 response
 to
 light
 stimuli,
 suggesting
 that
 different
 Hb
neurons
 might
 encode
 light
 stimuli
 in
 different
 ways.
 Moreover,
 a
higher
 tonic
 ﬁring
 rate
 of
 Hb
 neurons
 was
 observed
 during
 the
 day
compared
 to
 night-time
 [86]. When
 visual
 responses
 were
 mea-
sured
 during
 night-time,
 LHb
 neurons
 exhibit
 signiﬁcantly
 stronger
light
 responses
 compared
 to
 the
 MHb.
 Hence,
 visual
 responses
through
 a
 retinoic
 pathway
 in
 the
 rodent
 Hb
 [120,121], might
 there-
fore
 be
 modulated
 by
 circadian
 rhythms
 related
 to
 day-night
 cycles
and
 illumination
 levels.
Nonetheless,
 in
 vivo
 recordings
 of
 neural
 activity
 in
 the
 mam-
malian
 Hb
 remain
 challenging.
 It
 is
 thus
 unclear
 whether
 the
sensory
 responses
 in
 the
 mammalian
 Hb
 are
 part
 of
 an
 evolu-
tionarily
 conserved
 pathway
 or
 whether
 the
 afferent
 regulation
 of
this
 circuitry
 has
 changed
 throughout
 evolution
 [14]. Higher-order
brain
 areas
 that
 process
 more
 complex
 features
 of
 the
 sensory
 infor-
mation
 in
 mammals,
 might
 have
 replaced
 the
 direct
 sensory
 input
to
 the
 Hb
 that
 was
 observed
 in
 lampreys
 and
 teleosts.
 This
 could,
in
 turn,
 help
 mammals
 to
 better
 adapt
 their
 behavioral
 response
to
 contextual
 information
 that
 is
 not
 generated
 by
 direct
 sensory
inputs.
 Even
 if
 so,
 the
 common
 mechanism
 in
 which
 the
 Hb
 gen-
erates
 motivated
 behaviors
 based
 on
 contextual
 information
 and
updates
 the
 behavioral
 strategy
 to
 a
 more
 suitable
 outcome,
 is
 likely
to
 be
 preserved
 across
 all
 species.
 Yet
 how
 sensory
 responses
 in
the
 Hb
 and
 inputs
 from
 the
 limbic
 system
 or
 basal
 ganglia
 interact,
remains
 elusive.
 Hence,
 it
 will
 be
 essential
 to
 continue
 comparing
future
 results
 across
 different
 species,
 focusing
 on
 the
 role
 of
 habe-
nular
 circuitry
 in
 the
 contextual
 modulation
 of
 sensory
 processing.
3.
 Ongoing
 spontaneous
 activity
 in
 the
 habenula
Almost
 all
 measurements
 of
 neural
 activity
 throughout
 the
 brain
suggest
 that
 a
 signiﬁcant
 amount
 of
 activity
 is
 generated
 indepen-
dently
 from
 external
 sensory
 stimulation.
 This
 internally
 produced
spontaneous
 activity
 was
 previously
 undervalued,
 as
 for
 a
 long
 time
it
 was
 considered
 to
 be
 biophysical
 noise
 with
 no
 relevance
 in
 neu-
ronal
 computations
 [122]. Yet,
 the
 ongoing
 spontaneous
 activity
 of
neurons
 consumes
 a
 major
 part
 of
 the
 brain’s
 energy
 and
 is
 arguably
more
 than
 just
 an
 artifact
 [123]. Several
 studies
 have
 suggested
key
 roles
 for
 these
 intrinsic
 activity
 dynamics
 in
 diverse
 neural
processes
 from
 development
 and
 maturation
 of
 brain
 circuits
 to
cognitive
 performance.
Spontaneous
 bursts
 of
 activity
 were
 detected
 in
 different
 parts
of
 the
 nervous
 system
 across
 the
 animal
 kingdom.
 In
 the
 crus-
tacean
 stomatogastric
 system
 [124]
 and
 in
 the
 vertebrate
 spinal
cord
 [125], spontaneous
 activity
 is
 generally
 related
 to
 the
 genera-
tion
 of
 biological
 rhythms
 that
 control
 motor
 actions.
 However,
 the
purpose
 of
 ongoing
 activity
 in
 the
 brain
 such
 as
 the
 vertebrate
 cor-
tex
 [126–128], thalamus
 [129], hippocampus
 [130]
 and
 the
 Hb
 [96],
or
 in
 neural
 parts
 of
 sensory
 organs
 such
 as
 the
 retina
 [131,132], are
much
 more
 diverse
 and
 sometimes
 even
 elusive.
During
 development,
 spontaneous
 activity
 is
 important
 to
form
 appropriate
 connections
 and
 to
 generate
 a
 mature
 network
[129,131–133]. However,
 in
 mature
 networks,
 this
 activity
 has
been
 linked
 to
 various
 functions
 such
 as
 replay
 [130]
 and
 process-
ing
 of
 previous
 sensory
 experiences
 [134], memory
 consolidation
[135,136], and
 event
 planning
 [137]
 as
 well
 as
 the
 reorganiza-
tion
 of
 the
 synaptic
 weights
 of
 the
 network
 [138], bottom-up
thalamic
 control
 [139]
 and
 top-down
 modulation
 [140]. Such
 spon-
taneous
 activity
 can
 be
 generated
 intrinsically
 within
 one
 brain
 area
[141,142], by
 bottom
 up
 pathways
 [143]
 or
 by
 modulation
 from
distal
 areas
 either
 top-down
 or
 subcortical
 [144]. Moreover,
 sev-
eral
 studies
 suggest
 that
 spontaneous
 activity
 can
 reﬂect
 cortical
states,
 which
 can
 ‘gate’
 sensory
 information
 to
 higher
 brain
 areas
[144].
In humans,
 highly
 correlated
 spontaneous
 brain
 activity,
 is
 sug-
gested
 to
 reﬂect
 a
 ‘default
 mode
 network’
 [145]. In
 this
 functionally
deﬁned
 network,
 ongoing
 brain
 activity
 is
 not
 elicited
 by
 one
 sin-
gle
 brain
 region
 but
 is
 rather
 generated
 by
 dynamic
 interactions
 of
several
 brain
 regions
 across
 the
 brain.
 When
 the
 human
 brain

at
 rest
 or
 engaged
 in
 internally
 focused
 tasks,
 the
 default
 mode
network’
 is
 thought
 to
 be
 spontaneously
 active.
 If
 and
 how
 the
spontaneous
 activity
 of
 this
 network
 is
 altered
 by
 information
 from
the
 external
 world
 is
 still
 investigated.
 It
 has
 been
 hypothesized
that
 the
 spontaneous
 activity
 at
 rest
 can
 be
 counteracted
 or
 sup-
pressed
 by
 competing
 activity
 from
 additional
 brain
 regions
 that
are
 recruited
 during
 sensory
 processing
 or
 attention
 related
 tasks
[146–150]. On
 the
 contrary,
 a
 handful
 of
 cognitive
 tasks
 were
 also
shown
 to
 increase
 spontaneous
 activity
 [151]. In
 these
 cases
 ongo-
ing
 spontaneous
 activity
 could
 support
 a
 broad
 level
 of
 attention
when
 monitoring
 the
 external
 world
 for
 unexpected
 events
 [152].
While
 this
 idea
 of
 a
 functionally
 deﬁned
 default
 mode
 network,
 was
previously
 only
 applied
 to
 cortical
 areas,
 it
 is
 likely
 that
 other
 parts
of
 the
 brain,
 such
 as
 Hb,
 might
 be
 part
 of
 similar
 networks
 with
related
 network
 properties.
3.1.
 Implications
 of
 changing
 ongoing
 activity
 in
 habenular
circuits
The
 link
 between
 spontaneous
 habenular
 activity
 (Fig.
 2B)
 and
habenular
 inputs
 coming
 from
 converging
 pathways
 across
 the
brain
 is
 not
 well
 understood.
 Nonetheless,
 the
 hypothesis
 of
 the
 Hb
encoding
 expected
 reward
 value
 by
 altering
 its
 activity
 compared
to
 the
 baseline
 activity
 is
 now
 generally
 accepted
 [3,55]. Sponta-
neous
 activity
 in
 the
 Hb
 might
 therefore
 be
 a
 crucial
 feature,
 as
 is
it
 might
 enable
 a
 bidirectional
 coding
 of
 the
 reward
 expectation
value,
 as
 was
 observed
 with
 neurons
 encoding
 odors
 in
 the
 piri-
form
 cortex
 [153]. Such
 an
 increase
 in
 the
 dynamic
 range
 would
not
 be
 possible
 without
 a
 baseline
 activity.
Furthermore,
 several
 studies
 have
 suggested
 that
 changes
 in
spontaneous
 habenular
 activity
 might
 underlie
 behavioral
 symp-
toms
 observed
 in
 mood
 disorders
 or
 addiction.
 This
 is
 not
 very
surprising
 as
 the
 Hb
 is
 regulating
 monoaminergic
 brain
 regions
containing
 dopamine,
 serotonine
 and
 norepinephrine.
 Drugs
 like
cocaine
 for
 example,
 evoke
 withdrawal
 symptoms
 by
 a
 hyperacti-
vation
 of
 the
 LHb
 and
 strengthening
 of
 AMPAR-mediated
 synaptic
transmission
 onto
 RMTg
 neurons
 [154]. Acute
 application
 of
 nico-
tine
 on
 the
 other
 hand,
 increases
 spontaneously
 occurring
 action
potentials
 of
 the
 cholinergic
 neurons
 in
 the
 MHb
 via
 a
 speciﬁc
subtype
 of
 nAChR
 [155]. Blocking
 of
 spontaneous
 ﬁring
 in
 the
MHb,
 was
 shown
 to
 induce
 withdrawal-like
 symptoms
 similar
 to
nicotine
 withdrawal
 [155,156].
 The
 effects
 of
 morphine,
 an
 opi-
oid
 also
 inducing
 wirthdrawal-like
 symptoms,
 on
 the
 MHb
 activity
are
 less
 clear,
 since
 low
 and
 high
 doses
 respectively
 increased
 and
decreased
 spontaneous
 habenular
 activity
 [157,158]. It
 is
 highly
likely
 that
 such
 pharmacological
 alterations
 do
 not
 only
 affect
 the
Hb,
 instead
 this
 could
 alter
 the
 activity
 of
 a
 broadly
 dispersed
 brain
network,
 where
 Hb
 plays
 a
 key
 role.
Furthermore
 stress-inducing
 stimuli
 also
 excite
 neurons
 in
the
 LHb
 and
 prolonged
 stimulation
 could
 even
 generate
 anxiety
and
 depression
 [49,159,160].
 Multiple
 studies
 have
 shown
 that
increased
 background
 activity
 of
 the
 LHb
 is
 linked
 to
 anhedonia
(a
 behavioral
 symptom
 observed
 in
 some
 depressive
 patients),
by
 decreasing
 the
 activity
 of
 dopaminergic
 neurons
 after
 positive
events
 [76]. However,
 stress-induced
 activation
 of
 the
 LHb
 may
 not
only
 lead
 to
 changes
 in
 dopaminergic
 signaling
 but
 also
 to
 alter-
ations
 in
 the
 activity
 of
 serotonergic
 neurons
 located
 in
 the
 dorsal
and
 medial
 raphe
 nuclei
 [161–163].
Under
 general
 anesthesia,
 the
 amount
 of
 habenular
 activity
rises
 [164–166]
 which
 suggests
 that
 habenular
 activity
 can
 be
modulated
 during
 the
 transition
 from
 sleep/low
 arousal
 states
 to
awake/high
 arousal
 states.
 In
 line
 with
 this,
 ﬂuctuations
 in
 the
spontaneous
 activity
 of
 the
 Hb
 are
 regulated
 by
 circadian
 rhythms
[86,167].
 Precise
 mechanisms,
 which
 can
 underlie
 the
 role
 of
 the
Hb
 during
 sleep,
 remain
 to
 be
 elucidated,
 but
 proposed
 roles
 point
towards
 the
 control
 of
 serotonergic
 and
 possibly
 also
 dopaminergic
neurons
 [168–170].
Taken
 together,
 the
 spontaneous
 activity
 in
 the
 Hb,
 both
 in
LHb
 and
 MHb,
 appears
 to
 be
 altered
 in
 many
 different
 condi-
tions
 ranging
 from
 substance
 abuse
 to
 stress,
 sleep,
 reward-based
decision-making
 or
 even
 social
 behaviors.
 The
 baseline
 activity,
which
 can
 be
 characterized
 as
 the
 ongoing
 activity
 in
 the
 Hb
 with-
out
 any
 external
 stimulus,
 can
 therefore
 represent
 an
 internal
 state
of
 the
 animal.
 Depending
 on
 the
 sensory
 inputs
 or
 internal
 informa-
tion
 from
 other
 brain
 areas
 that
 are
 directly
 or
 indirectly
 projecting
to
 the
 Hb,
 this
 activity
 can
 be
 modulated
 to
 eventually
 trigger
behaviors
 that
 are
 better
 adapted
 to
 a
 given
 situation.
3.2.
 Interactions
 of
 spontaneous
 and
 sensory
 driven
 activity
 in
the
 habenula
While
 all
 phenomena
 described
 above
 have
 a
 strong
 relation
to
 changing
 levels
 of
 spontaneous
 habenular
 activity,
 it
 is
 less
 clear
how
 sensory
 responses
 in
 the
 Hb
 and
 spontaneous
 habenular
 activ-
ity
 interact
 with
 each
 other.
 One
 possibility
 is
 that
 spontaneous
activity
 alters
 sensory
 responses
 in
 the
 Hb
 and
 changes
 the
 way
the
 Hb
 transmits
 sensory
 information
 to
 its
 monoaminergic
 tar-
gets.
 Alternatively,
 sensory
 responses
 in
 the
 Hb
 could
 also
 interfere
with
 the
 spontaneous
 activity
 and
 therefore
 modulate
 the
 phenom-
ena
 that
 are
 attributed
 to
 spontaneous
 habenular
 activity,
 such
 as
cognitive
 function,
 depression,
 addiction,
 sleep
 or
 social
 behaviors.
Since
 the
 Hb
 receives
 inputs
 from
 both
 sensory
 and
 non-sensory
regions
 of
 the
 forebrain,
 midbrain
 and
 hindbrain
 [1,2,4–16], one
potential
 role
 of
 spontaneous
 habenular
 activity
 could
 be
 to
 serve
as
 a
 gate
 or
 a
 switchboard.
 In
 such
 a
 model,
 the
 responsiveness
 of
Hb
 neurons
 to
 sensory
 stimulation
 could
 be
 modulated
 (or
 gated)
by
 the
 non-sensory
 inputs
 of
 the
 Hb
 that
 are
 shaping
 its
 ongoing
activity.
 We  have
 previously
 shown
 that
 spontaneous
 activity
 in
 the
zebraﬁsh
 dHb
 is
 not
 random,
 but
 rather
 spatially
 organized
 into
 dif-
ferent
 functionally
 and
 genetically
 distinct
 clusters
 [96]
 (Fig.
 2B).
Neurotransmitter
 maps
 of
 the
 dHb
 were
 shown
 to
 have
 a
 spatial
organization
 that
 is
 asymmetric
 across
 habenular
 hemispheres
 and
this
 organization
 is
 preserved
 in
 the
 targets
 of
 the
 Hb
 [171]
 (Fig.
 2C).
Hence,
 it
 would
 be
 interesting
 to
 classify
 what
 functional
 Hb
 clus-
ters
 identiﬁed
 based
 on
 their
 ongoing
 activity,
 overlap
 with
 the
neurotransmitter
 expression
 patterns
 observed
 in
 the
 Hb.
Additionally,
 we  showed
 that
 the
 neurons
 belonging
 to
 a
 func-
tional
 cluster
 during
 spontaneous
 habenular
 activity
 also
 respond
similarly
 to
 sensory
 stimulation.
 Hence,
 in
 principle,
 modulating
the
 spontaneous
 activity
 of
 a
 given
 Hb
 cluster
 could
 also
 alter
 the
responsiveness
 of
 those
 Hb
 neurons
 to
 a
 given
 sensory
 modal-
ity,
 by
 increasing
 or
 decreasing
 their
 resting
 membrane
 potential.
This
 process
 would
 in
 turn
 control
 if
 or
 when
 the
 sensory
 infor-
mation
 should
 be
 passed
 to
 monoaminergic
 Hb
 targets
 in
 the
locus
 coeruleus
 (LC),
 the
 VTA
 and
 the
 Raphe.
 Therefore,
 it
 will
be
 interesting
 to
 modulate
 spontaneous
 habenular
 activity
 via
direct
 stimulation
 of
 Hb
 inputs
 across
 the
 brain,
 or
 to
 utilize
 those
behavioral
 phenomena
 that
 could
 regulate
 spontaneous
 habenular
activity
 such
 as
 stress
 or
 sleep,
 to
 test
 whether
 altering
 spontaneous
habenular
 activity
 can
 modulate
 sensory
 representations
 within
the
 Hb
 and
 in
 turn
 alter
 the
 animal’s
 behavioral
 response
 to
 sensory
stimuli.
It
 is
 possible
 that
 the
 functional
 clusters
 observed
 in
 ongoing
habenular
 activity
 could
 represent

marking
 the
 groups
 of
 neurons
 that
 are
 more
 likely
 to
 act

 a

 behavioral
 program.
 In
 line
 with
 this
 hypothe-
sis,
 functional
 clusters
 of
 Hb
 neurons
 with
 synchronized
 ongoing
activity
 were
 shown
 to
 overlap
 with
 genetically
 labeled
 groups
 of
Hb
 neurons
 [96], which
 were
 shown
 to
 be
 involved
 in
 associative
fear
 learning
 [49]. It
 is
 exciting
 to
 speculate
 that
 these
 stable
 func-
tional
 clusters
 of
 Hb
 neurons
 that
 are

 co-active)

all
 times,
 represent
 favored
 states
 of
 the
 habenular
 circuits.
 These
favored
 states
 of
 the
 habenular
 circuits
 resemble
 an
 attractor
 net-
work,
 which
 is
 a
 network
 of
 recurrently
 connected
 neurons,
 whose
dynamics
 settle
 to
 stable
 states.
 Such
 stable
 states
 are
 generally
believed
 to
 be
 involved
 in
 decision
 making
 and
 provide
 the
 network
with
 an
 increase
 in
 signal-to-noise
 ratio
 resulting
 in
 a
 better
 signal
classiﬁcation
 and
 discretisation
 [172–174].
 In
 the
 mammalian
 cor-
tex,
 attractor
 networks
 are
 proposed
 to
 be
 involved
 in
 gating
 and
gain
 control
 of
 sensory
 information
 [175]. Hence,
 these
 principles
could
 also
 apply
 to
 sensory
 processing
 within
 the
 Hb.
 For
 example
odorant-evoked
 responses
 with
 different
 amplitudes
 and
 distinct
representations
 in
 the
 OB,
 were
 no
 longer
 observed
 in
 dHb
 neurons.
[96]. Instead
 dHb
 neurons
 are
 broadly
 tuned
 to
 odors
 which
 sug-
gests
 that
 discrimination
 between
 odorant
 classes
 might
 no
 longer
be
 relevant
 for
 Hb
 computations.
 A
 robust
 response
 that
 encodes
saliency
 or
 presence
 of
 a
 broad
 odor
 signal
 could
 be
 achieved
 by
keeping
 the
 network
 in
 a
 preferred
 excitable
 state.
 It
 is
 also
 pos-
sible
 that
 these
 stable
 states
 of
 the
 Hb
 networks
 can
 be
 entrained
to
 increase
 the
 response
 likelihood
 of
 Hb
 neurons
 to
 a
 given
 sen-
sory
 modality
 through
 an
 associative
 learning
 process.
 The
 Hb
 was
indeed
 shown
 to
 be
 involved
 in
 such
 processes
 through
 reward
prediction
 and
 error
 estimation.
 One
 way
 to
 test
 this
 hypothesis
is
 to
 measure
 the
 changes
 in
 Hb
 spontaneous
 activity
 throughout
the
 process
 of
 associative
 learning.
 Along
 with
 this
 hypothesis,
 the
cognitive
 capacities
 involved
 in
 associative
 learning
 were
 shown
 to
improve
 drastically
 within
 the
 ﬁrst
 weeks
 of
 development
 [176]. As
the
 Hb
 plays
 a
 role
 in
 this
 associative
 learning
 process,
 it
 is
 likely
that
 the
 spontaneous
 activity
 of
 Hb
 circuits
 might
 change,
 as
 the
 Hb
input
 regions
 across
 the
 brain
 mature
 throughout
 development.
 It
would
 therefore
 be
 exciting
 to
 study
 the
 processes
 that
 regulate
sensory
 responses
 and
 spontaneous
 activity
 of
 Hb
 neurons
 across
different
 stages
 of
 development
 and
 test
 if
 different
 types
 of
 inputs
to
 the
 Hb,
 from
 sensory,
 limbic
 and
 cortical
 brain
 regions
 arrive
with
 a
 developmental
 order
 and
 whether
 spontaneous
 habenular
activity
 shapes
 the
 fate
 and
 the
 function
 of
 Hb
 neurons.
One
 ﬁnal
 possibility
 is
 that
 the
 spontaneous
 habenular
 activ-
ity
 constantly
 links
 the
 cortical
 or
 limbic
 inputs
 of
 the
 Hb
 to
monoaminergic
 Hb
 targets.
 In
 this
 manner,
 the
 Hb
 receives
 infor-
mation
 from
 these
 input
 regions
 about
 the
 animal’s
 internal
 states
(such
 as
 fear,
 stress,
 attention,
 learned
 outcomes)
 and
 spontaneous
activity
 is
 regulated
 accordingly.
 The
 habenula
 can
 then
 act
 as
 a
hub
 and
 relay
 the
 information
 received
 from
 Hb
 input
 regions
 to
the
 neuromodulatory
 nuclei
 that
 control
 behavior.
 In
 this
 scenario,
the
 sensory
 inputs
 to
 the
 Hb
 might
 interfere
 with
 ongoing
 habe-
nular
 activity
 by
 potentiating
 or
 disengaging
 the
 link
 between
 Hb
inputs
 and
 Hb
 targets.
 This
 can
 then
 allow
 to
 activate
 or
 suppress
 a
given
 behavioral
 program
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 a
 salient
 sensory
 stim-
ulus.
 The
 vast
 literature
 on
 the
 Hb
 and
 its
 function
 covers
 several
disciplines.
 While
 most
 studies
 in
 the
 human,
 primate
 and
 rodent
Hb
 focus
 on
 reward
 prediction,
 addiction
 and
 stress,
 work
 on
 the
Hb
 of
 many
 lower
 vertebrates
 focuses
 on
 the
 representations
 of
different
 sensory
 modalities
 in
 the
 Hb
 as
 well
 as
 the
 asymmetric
architecture
 and
 function
 of
 habenular
 circuits.
 There
 is
 a
 strong
parallelism
 in
 molecular
 and
 functional
 architecture
 of
 the
 verte-
brate
 Hb
 as
 well
 as
 in
 its
 role
 in
 regulating
 behavior
 in
 general.
However,
 further
 research
 is
 needed
 in
 order
 to
 understand
 the
interplay
 between
 sensory
 information
 from
 the
 external
 world
and
 the
 internally
 generated
 spontaneous
 activity
 of
 the
 Hb
 and
how
 these
 interactions
 relate
 to
 the
 roles
 of
 the
 Hb
 in
 controlling
animal
 behavior.

The developing brain undergoes drastic alterations. Here, we investigated developmental changes in the 
habenula, a brain region that mediates behavioral flexibility during learning, social interactions, and aversive 
experiences. We showed that developing habenular circuits exhibit multiple alterations that lead to an increase in 
the structural and functional diversity of cell types, inputs, and functional modules. As the habenula develops, it 
sequentially transforms into a multisensory brain region that can process visual, olfactory, mechanosensory, and 
aversive stimuli. Moreover, we observed that the habenular neurons display spatiotemporally structured sponta-
neous activity that shows prominent alterations and refinement with age. These alterations in habenular activity 
are accompanied by sequential neurogenesis and the integration of distinct neural clusters across development. 
Last, we revealed that habenular neurons with distinct functional properties are born sequentially at distinct 
developmental time windows. Our results highlight a strong link between the functional properties of habenular 
neurons and their precise birthdate.
INTRODUCTION
During development and maturation, the functional capacity of 
brain circuits increases to support the animals’ expanding behavioral 
repertoire. For example, while a young zebrafish larva mostly needs 
to avoid threats and find food, more cognitively demanding behav-
iors such as associative learning (1, 2) or social interactions (3) 
emerge later in development during the juvenile stage around 3 to 
4 weeks. Such an expansion of the behavioral repertoire is a feature 
that is conserved across vertebrates (4) and is often accompanied 
with the development, establishment, and maturation of distinct 
circuit components generating functional modules within the brain 
(5). Hence, brain development and maturation is not only a linear 
expansion of the already existing building blocks but also a sequential 
increase in the diversity of functional modules and cell types. In the 
cortex, for example, individual layers are born at different time 
points, with deep layers being born earlier than superficial layers 
(6), creating a diversity in the cytoarchitecture of cortical layers and 
regions with distinct functions (5, 7). Similarly, this chronological 
order of neurogenesis in larval zebrafish hindbrain and spinal cord was 
shown to generate functional diversity of neurons, which underlies 
increased sophistication of behaviors across development (8–10).
The maturation and refinement of the developing brain rely on 
neural activity that can be evoked by sensory inputs (11, 12) or 
spontaneously generated (11, 13). In most sensory systems, sensory-­
evoked activity was shown to be critical for the maturation of neural 
circuits and the refinement of topographical maps (12, 14). The 
appearance of spontaneous activity of the developing brain starts 
early and coincides with periods of intense synaptogenesis and neu-
ronal growth (15). For example, spontaneous activity bursts were 
observed in the visual, auditory, and somatosensory systems and 
are shown to be important for the remodeling of these structures 
(13, 14). In higher brain regions, such as the hippocampus, large 
and slow bursts are observed (16) before the appearance of faster 
rhythms and the patterned activity of the adult hippocampus asso-
ciated with learning and memory. Furthermore, spontaneous activ-
ity is also involved in the maturation of connections across distant 
brain regions, as observed between the olfactory bulb and the ento-
rhinal cortex (17). Last, the synchronous bursting during sponta-
neous activity that is important in establishing neural connectivity 
was shown to be mediated via excitatory connections (18), gap 
junctions (19), glial cells (20), or other support cells (21). Together, 
both sensory-driven and spontaneous neural activity are essential in 
the development and maturation of neural circuits. It is, however, 
less clear how sensory-evoked and spontaneous neural activity 
interact as the animals develop.
While the majority of studies have focused on the development 
of sensory and motor systems, less is known about the maturation 
of higher brain areas integrating information from multiple brain 
regions, such as the habenula. The habenula is a particularly inter-
esting brain region, as it was shown to integrate both sensory 
(22, 23) and corticolimbic inputs (24–26) while directly regulating 
the function of monoaminergic brain nuclei controlling behavior 
(23, 25, 27). Dysfunction of the habenula is also shown to be associated 
with several neurological conditions and mood disorders including 
depression (28). The habenula is composed of several subdomains 
or modules based on its neurochemical profiles (29, 30), anatomical 
projections (31–33), and the activity of habenular neurons (33–35).

Two major subnuclei, the lateral and medial habenula in mammals, 
respectively, and the dorsal habenula (dHb) and ventral habenula (vHb) in 
zebrafish, have clear differences in their functional and molecular 
profiles (33). While the dHb is involved in sensory processing (23, 34, 35), 
aggression (36), and experience-dependent fear response (27, 31), the 
vHb was shown to play a role in avoidance learning (33) and active 
coping behavior (37). In zebrafish, dHb and vHb originate from separate 
neural progenitor pools and were suggested to maturate at distinct 
developmental time points (32). Moreover, the dHb was shown to 
undergo asymmetric neurogenesis during the early stages of devel-
opment, with left dHb neurons being born earlier than the ones in the 
right hemisphere (38). The prominent asymmetry in the molecular 
(29) and anatomical properties of habenula (39) is also reflected in 
its asymmetric encoding of visual and olfactory information in the 
left and the right dHb hemispheres, respectively (34, 35). Recent 
transcriptome analysis further revealed multiple molecularly distinct 
and spatially organized functional modules within the zebrafish (30) 
and mammalian (40) habenula, which resemble the spatially organized 
functional clusters of habenular neurons during spontaneous activity 
(35). All of these evidences suggest a fine spatial organization of distinct 
functional modules within habenula (35). In addition, spontaneous 
habenular activity was shown to govern sensory responses and, 
therefore, proposed to represent internal states of the network, 
which could mediate the selection of appropriate behaviors (35). A 
recent study revealed a sequential recruitment of neurons generating 
an increase in vHb activity, during the switch from active to passive 
coping behaviors in juvenile zebrafish (37). Such complex behaviors 
emerge at later stages of zebrafish development (1, 3), suggesting 
pronounced changes in the underlying circuitry across the brain. 
Despite extensive characterization of habenular circuitry during 
very early developmental stages (29, 38, 39), it is still unclear how 
the maturation of habenular networks during development corre-
sponds to the establishment of its distinct functional modules.
In this study, we investigated how the function and the architecture 
of habenular networks change across development and how these 
alterations relate to the formation of distinct functional modules 
within habenula. We showed that as the habenula expands, the number 
of neurons increases, inhibitory connections are formed, and sensory 
inputs are integrated with a temporal order. Moreover, we revealed 
that the habenula is a multisensory brain region, which distinctly 
encodes different sensory modalities. Visual and olfactory responses in 
habenula develop early, while the responses to mechanosensory and 
aversive stimuli develop at later stages. Spontaneous habenular activity 
is present already at early developmental stages, and it is predictive of the 
habenular neurons with sensory responses. We observed a prominent 
restructuring of both spatial and temporal features of spontaneous 
habenular activity during development. These functional changes 
in the habenula were accompanied by a sequential and spatially 
organized addition of newly born neurons across development. Last, 
we showed that habenular neurons born at a distinct developmental 
stage exhibit similar functional properties. Our observations support 
the idea that neuronal birthdate and function are strongly related.
RESULTS
New neurons and new inhibitory connections are added 
to habenula during development
To study the functional development of zebrafish habenula, we 
focused on three developmental stages: early larval stage [3 days 
post-fertilization (dpf)], late larval stage (6 dpf), and juvenile stage 
(21 dpf). During these periods, zebrafish transition from self-feeding 
larvae (via the yolk sac) to an external feeding juvenile animal with 
more complex behaviors including those involving habenular circuits 
(1, 3, 31, 33, 37). First, we visualized the gross morphology of habenula 
in Tg(elavl3:GCaMP6s) (41) zebrafish, labeling most habenular 
neurons. We observed that the number of habenular neurons increases 
drastically from 3 to 21 days of zebrafish development (Fig. 1, A and B). 
Next, we investigated the expression of glutamate and -aminobutyric 
acid (GABA) by using Tg(vglut2a:dsRed) (22) and Tg(gad1b:GFP) 
(42) zebrafish. We found that at 3 dpf, habenula mainly consists of 
glutamatergic neurons, and as the animal gets older, few GABAergic 
neurons are added (Fig. 1C). From 6 dpf, we also observed prominent 
bilateral GABAergic projections that innervate specific domains at 
the lateral sides of habenula (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that 
habenula undergoes a nonlinear expansion with the addition of new 
cell types and inputs arriving at different time points throughout 
development.
Sensory inputs and computations in habenula follow 
a developmental order
Previous studies showed that habenula receives olfactory (22) and 
visual (23) inputs and responds to both of these sensory modalities 
(34, 35, 43). To investigate how these sensory inputs maturate 
during habenula development, we visualized the mitral cell and 
thalamic axon terminals in habenula using Tg(lhx2a:gap-YFP) (22) and 
Et(−0.6hsp70l:Gal4-VP16) s1020t; Tg(UAS:nfsB-mCherry) (31, 44) 
zebrafish lines, respectively. At all ages, thalamic projections were 
found to innervate habenula (Fig. 2A, blue) in distinct locations that 
are different from GABAergic innervations (Fig. 2A, white) or 
mitral cell terminals (Fig. 2A, red). Yet, the density of olfactory bulb 
projections increased with age (Fig. 2A, red). These findings suggest 
that habenular neurons may be predominantly light responsive at 
younger ages, while odor responses develop later. To test this 
hypothesis, we measured odor (food odor) and light (red light flash) 
responses in the habenula by using two-photon calcium imaging 
in Tg(elavl3:GCaMP6s) (41) zebrafish. At 3 dpf, we found that a 
significantly higher portion of habenular neurons responds to the 
visual stimulus compared to food odor (Fig. 2, B and C). As zebrafish 
develop, the ratio of odor- and light-responding neurons became 
similar (Fig. 2, B and C). At all developmental stages, correlations 
between visual and olfactory stimuli were relatively low (Fig. 2D).
To further test whether the development of sensory responses in 
habenula is biased toward aversive or attractive stimuli within one 
sensory modality, we applied amino acid odor, food odor, skin 
extract, and ammonia, which were previously shown to elicit responses 
in the zebrafish habenula (35). Moreover, earlier studies revealed 
that amino acid odor (45) and food odor (46) elicit attraction, and 
skin extract (47) and ammonia (46) elicit freezing and defensive 
behaviors. While we did not observe any preference for habenular 
neurons to respond to aversive or attractive odors in 3-dpf zebrafish 
larvae, we observed that stimulation with aversive odors resulted in 
a higher number of responding neurons compared to attractive 
odors, in four out of four 21-dpf zebrafish (fig. S1, A and B). The 
correlations between aversive versus attractive odors were low in 
3 dpf and increased at 21 dpf (fig. S1, C and D).
Previous studies showed that the zebrafish habenula can encode 
a diverse range of aversive experiences (27, 30, 37). To test the 
developmental order of zebrafish habenula for encoding aversive

stimuli, we applied mechanical vibrations (48) and mild electric 
stimulation (27, 30, 37), both of which were shown to generate aversive 
reactions in developing zebrafish (27, 30, 37, 48). We also compared 
these aversive stimuli to visual responses in the habenula evoked by 
red light. Consistent with our results above (Fig. 2), the zebrafish 
habenula predominantly responds to visual stimulation at 3 dpf 
(Fig. 3, A and B). As zebrafish develop, we observed that a signifi-
cantly larger number of habenular neurons responded to mild 
electric stimulation at 6 and 21 dpf (Fig. 3B). Moreover, we observed 
that significantly larger number of habenular neurons respond to 
light compared to mechanical vibrations at 6 dpf (Fig. 3B). At 21 dpf, 
we no longer observed any significant difference between the number 
of neurons responding to light, electric stimuli, and vibrations 
(Fig. 3B). These three different stimulus modalities exhibit low 
correlations at all developmental stages (Fig. 3C). All these results 
suggest that while the 3-dpf habenula preferentially responds to 
light, the animal develops significantly more habenular neurons 
respond to aversive electrical stimuli, as the animal develops. Together, 
the developing habenula can selectively encode an expanding number 
of sensory modalities with an increasing preference for aversive 
electrical stimuli at later stages.
Functional lateralization of visual and olfactory responses 
decreases across development, and it is not prominent 
for aversive stimuli
Earlier studies revealed a strong molecular (29, 32) and functional 
(34) lateralization of habenular networks, especially across the 
dHb hemispheres of larval zebrafish. There is no evidence for such 
lateralization in the rodent habenula, which is mostly studied in 
adults by using aversive stimuli (25, 26). This made us question 
whether the ontogeny of functional lateralization in the zebrafish 
habenula might resemble the phylogeny of the vertebrate habenula, 
where lateralized responses to light and odors appear first and non-
lateralized responses to aversive stimuli develop later. To test this 
hypothesis, we investigated the lateralization of sensory responses 
in habenular neurons across zebrafish development. First, we showed 
that the dorsal sections of habenula, which likely cover the dHb, 
exhibit lateralized visual and olfactory responses at all ages (Fig. 4, 
A and B). We quantified this functional lateralization by measuring 
the ratio of light- versus odor-responding habenular neurons across 
hemispheres (34) and by using a lateralization index, where 0 
represents symmetry and 1 represents complete segregation of light 
and odor responses across hemispheres. Across development, dHb 
exhibits high functional lateralization of light and odor responses, 
when compared to the ventral sections of habenula (Fig. 4B). Yet, 
we also observed that the functional lateralization of habenular 
circuits significantly decreases across development (Fig. 4, C and D). 
Despite this decrease, light and odor responses exhibit prominent 
spatial organization (Fig. 4E), quantified by the focality index, ranging 
from 0 (for random spatial distribution of sensory responses) to 1 
(for maximally focal sensory responses) (49). Instead, aversive stimuli 
elicited no such lateralization across habenular hemispheres (fig. S2), 
resembling the nonlateralized aversive cue representations in the 
rodent habenula (25, 26). These results indicate that functional 
lateralization is a feature of dHb (34) that develops earlier and 
preferentially responds to visual and olfactory stimuli. Instead, vHb,

which develops later during development, does not exhibit prominent 
functional lateralization.
Functional clusters of habenular neurons exhibit spatially 
organized spontaneous activity at all ages
In juvenile zebrafish, spatially organized functional clusters of 
habenular neurons display synchronous bursts of spontaneous 
activity, which is present even in the absence of sensory inputs (35). 
It is, however, less clear if such spontaneous activity is also present 
in younger zebrafish larvae and to what extent it changes across 
habenular development. To study this, we recorded ongoing 
habenular activity in the absence of external stimuli at different 
developmental stages. We observed that clusters of habenular neurons 
exhibit correlated spontaneous activity already at 3 dpf (Fig. 5A). 
Next, we investigated the stability of these functional clusters during 
different time windows, using k-means clustering (35). We showed

that at all developmental stages, a large portion of habenular neu-
rons that belong to a functional cluster remain in their respective 
cluster with a significantly higher probability compared to chance 
levels (Fig. 5B). To investigate the synchrony between the habenular 
neurons further, we next computed the ratio of significantly posi-
tive and negative correlated pairs of habenular neurons. We ob-
served that as the animal develops, more pairs of neurons displayed 
significant and robust positive correlations (Fig. 5C). We did not 
observe such a change for negative correlations between habenular 
neurons (Fig. 5D). Next, we investigated the spatial organization of

synchronous habenular activity by plotting the average pairwise 
correlation of neurons versus the distance between them. We ob-
served that while nearby habenular neurons have more correlated 
spontaneous activity at all developmental stages, they exhibit sig-
nificantly stronger correlations during older developmental stages 
(Fig. 5E). This increase in the ratio (Fig. 5C) and strength (Fig. 5E) 
of positive correlations is likely due to the maturation of synaptic 
connections between habenular neurons, as well as the arrival of 
synaptic inputs to habenula.
Next, we investigated whether habenular neurons with correlated 
spontaneous activity also respond to sensory stimulation similarly 
and how this changes across development. We observed that, 
especially at later developmental stages, odor- and light-responsive 
habenular neurons largely overlap with the distinct functional 
clusters with correlated spontaneous activity, compared to the same 
number of randomly selected nonsensory neurons (Fig. 5, F and G). 
This was also true when comparing sensory responding neurons to 
all nonresponding neurons (fig. S3). Only in older zebrafish did we 
observe that odor- or light-responding habenular neurons exhibit a 
significantly higher ratio of positive correlations during sponta-
neous activity, compared to the same number of randomly selected 
nonsensory habenular neurons (Fig. 5H). These results highlight 
the developmental maturation of habenular circuits while generat-
ing more structured spontaneous activity that better predicts the 
sensory response characteristics of habenular neurons.
Features of spontaneous habenular activity change  
during development
Our results revealed that already at early developmental stages, the 
habenula exhibits prominent spontaneous activity. In several brain 
regions, spontaneous activity during early development is generally 
characterized as large bursts with long quiescent intervals (16), 
whereas adult brains usually exhibit rhythmic activity at faster 
frequencies (16, 50). To test whether the temporal features of 
habenular activity are changing over development, we detected the 
spontaneous activity bursts (51) (Fig. 6A) and quantified the fre-
quency and duration of these events. We observed that as the animals 
develop, the frequency of spontaneous activity bursts significantly 
increases (Fig. 6B) and their duration decreases (Fig. 6C). Moreover, 
while the average activity of habenular neurons decreases (Fig. 6D), 
a larger proportion of habenular neurons shows spontaneous activity 
(Fig. 6E) at later developmental stages. These results are in line with 
the developmental changes observed in other vertebrate brain 
regions and highlight the maturation of habenular spontaneous 
activity across development.
Next, we asked whether such temporal features (i.e., burst duration 
and frequency) of spontaneous habenular activity are also spatially 
organized. We quantified the spatial distribution by using the measure 
of focality index, ranging from 0 (for random spatial distribution) 
to 1 (for an extremely focal point) (49). At all developmental stages, 
the temporal features of habenular spontaneous activity, burst 
frequency, and duration were highly focal and not randomly dis-
tributed (Fig. 6F, also note the mean focality values). To further 
investigate the spatial distribution of habenular activity at different 
developmental stages, we adopted a commonly used reporter of 
neural activity, phospho-ERK (extracellular signal–regulated kinase)/
total-ERK (pERK/tERK) ratio (52). We observed that during early 
developmental stages, pERK/tERK ratio is distributed rather uniformly 
across the habenula (Fig. 6, G and H, top), while at later developmental 
stages, pERK/tERK ratio was concentrated more laterally (Fig. 6, 
G and H, bottom), indicating a higher neural activity toward the 
lateral ends of habenula. We also observed that the most silent 
habenular neurons (black dots in Fig. 5F) were located closer to 
the medial wall of habenula (Fig. 6I), near the location of habenular 
neural progenitors labeled in Tg(her4.1:GFP) (53) zebrafish (Fig. 7A).
Since the juvenile zebrafish habenula displayed an increased 
pERK/tERK ratio toward the lateral ends (Fig. 6, G and H) and a 
higher number of silent neurons toward the medial ends (Fig. 6I), 
we hypothesized that the mediolateral distribution of habenular 
neurons at older stages might represent their physiological and 
developmental maturity. To test this hypothesis, we performed in-
tracellular recordings of habenular neurons across the mediolateral 
axis of juvenile zebrafish at later developmental stages. We observed 
that the input resistance, a hallmark of developmental maturation 
of cortical neurons (7), was significantly higher for medial habenular 
neurons, compared to lateral habenular neurons (Fig. 6J). Together, 
this suggests that neurons near the lateral ends of habenula might 
be more mature neurons that are born during early developmental 
stages, compared to medial habenula neurons born later.
Distinct spatial domains of habenular neurons are born 
through sequential neurogenesis
Next, we asked whether the spatial organization of habenula across 
the mediolateral axis might be a result of sequential neurogenesis 
across development. To test this hypothesis, we first investigated 
the location of habenular neurogenesis. We observed that neural 
progenitors labeled by Tg(her4.1:GFP) (53) expression are located 
at the medial walls of habenular hemispheres (Fig. 7A). To further 
investigate the relationship between the birthdate of habenular 
neurons and their spatial distribution, we labeled habenular neurons 
born during different developmental stages using 5-bromo-2′-­
deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation (Fig. 7B). BrdU birthdating 
showed that the habenular neurons that are born during distinct 
developmental stages were spatially organized (Fig. 7C). Moreover, 
we observed that the birthdate of habenular neurons is a good indi-
cator for their spatial location, where oldest neurons (born early in 
development) mostly occupied the lateral wall of habenula and 
youngest neurons (born late in development) were closest to the 
medial wall (Fig. 7, C and D).
Next, we developed an in vivo birthdating method to further 
investigate the distinct clusters of habenular neurons that are born 
during different developmental stages. To do this, we adopted a 
previously described approach to label cohorts of mammalian 
cortical neurons born at distinct developmental stages (54). We 
achieved this by injecting two different colors (far-red and green) of 
a fluorescent cell tracer in the telencephalic ventricle (55), near the 
neural progenitor zone on the medial wall of habenula (Fig. 7A) of 
2.5- and 5-dpf zebrafish larvae (Fig. 7E). Fifteen hours after the cell 
tracer injections, only the cells near the medial wall of habenula 
were labeled (Fig. 7E). We raised the zebrafish larvae injected with 
cell tracers of two different colors (far-red and green) until 12 and 
21 dpf and visualized the cohorts of birthdated habenular neurons 
in living juvenile zebrafish (Fig. 7F). Our results revealed a distinct 
spatial organization of habenular neurons birthdated at 2.5 dpf, 
compared to the neurons birthdated at 5 dpf (Fig. 7F). Further-
more, we observed less than 4% overlap of birthdated neurons by 
injections at 2.5 versus 5 dpf, highlighting the temporal resolution 
of our in vivo birthdating method (Fig. 7G). In addition, these

experiments also revealed that the number of neurons birthdated 
at 2.5 dpf was almost double the number of neurons birthdated at 
5 dpf (Fig. 7, H and I). This higher rate of habenular neurogenesis at 
earlier developmental stages is also in line with our observation for 
a larger number of phospho–histone 3–labeled mitotic cells in 
habenula at earlier developmental stages (Fig. 7, J to K). Together, 
our results revealed that sequential neurogenesis in habenula generates 
spatially organized, nonoverlapping clusters of habenular neurons.
Habenular neurons born at a distinct developmental stage 
form a distinct functional cluster
Our results in previous sections indicate a potential relationship be-
tween the birthdate of habenular neurons, spatial location, and their 
functional properties. On the basis of these results, we hypothesized 
that the habenular neurons that are born together might form distinct 
functional clusters in habenula, with similar features of spontaneous 
activity. To test this hypothesis, we injected a far-red fluorescence

and Z3 represent later-born neurons with descending order of 
maturity (Z1 > Z2 > Z3) (Fig. 8, G to Q).
Our analysis revealed notable differences in the functional 
features of the spontaneous activity between habenular neurons 
born at different developmental stages, corresponding to distinct 
spatial zones. Earlier born habenular neurons displayed stronger 
spontaneous activity (Fig. 8, B, C, L, and M) with higher frequency 
(Fig. 8, D to N) and duration (Fig. 8E). Moreover, earlier born 
habenular neurons showed a significantly larger number of pairwise 
correlations, compared to later-born habenular neurons (Fig. 8, 
F and P). Our results suggest that distinct functional clusters of 
habenular neurons with distinct functional features are born at 
different developmental stages. To test this idea further, we asked 
whether the developmentally tagged neurons are also related to the 
spatially organized functional clusters within habenula, observed 
earlier (Fig. 4, A to D) (35). To this end, we clustered the spontaneous 
habenular activity using k-means clustering (Fig. 8, H, I, R, and S) 
and calculated the overlap between developmentally tagged neurons 
and functional clusters, using a “cluster selectivity” index (35). If 
developmentally tagged neurons in different habenular zones overlap 
with one functional cluster, cluster selectivity would result in 1. We 
observed that the developmentally tagged habenular neurons in 
each zone overlap with significantly fewer clusters, when compared 
to the same number of randomly selected habenular neurons 
(Fig. 8, J to T). These results revealed that distinct functional 
clusters of spatially organized habenular neurons are born at 
distinct developmental stages and exhibit similar features of 
spontaneous activity.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we investigated the functional development of 
habenular circuits in zebrafish across development from young 
larvae with relatively simple behaviors to juvenile zebrafish with 
complex behaviors (1–3, 33, 36, 37). The use of juvenile zebrafish 
is gaining popularity due to their transparent brains and their 
expanded behavioral repertoire that requires habenular function 
(1–3, 37). Our results revealed that as the zebrafish develop from 
the larval to the juvenile stage, habenular circuits undergo multiple 
transitions in its architecture, sensory computations, and intrin-
sically generated spontaneous activity, which could support the 
expansion of the behavioral repertoire during development.
Previous studies indicate the presence of olfactory (34, 35) and 
visual (23, 34) responses in habenula, which were suggested to be 
involved in generating odor avoidance (43) and light preference 
(23). Both visual (20) and olfactory (56) responses are reported in 
sensory organs of 2.5-day-old zebrafish larvae. However, the precise 
developmental maturation of these sensory inputs in habenula has 
not been investigated. Our results revealed that at early develop-
mental stages, habenula is first innervated by the visual inputs, 
which are followed by the olfactory inputs. This is also in line with 
our observation of light responses dominating habenula of larval 
zebrafish followed by olfactory responses. We observed that aver-
sive mild electric stimulation (27, 30, 37) elicits responses in 
habenula during later developmental stages. This gradual increase 
in stimulus diversity of habenular responses likely reflects a devel-
opmental transition of habenula into a multisensory processing 
brain region, which can encode stimulus salience and valance. We 
observed that visual, olfactory, vibrational, and electric stimuli are 
distinctly encoded by the activation of separate neural populations. 
Such distinct encoding of different sensory modalities at all devel-
opmental stages highlights the important role of habenula in inte-
grating information from multiple sensory systems (23, 34, 35, 43, 57). 
Future experiments are needed to identify the specific role of 
habenular circuits for distinguishing salience and valance across 
multiple sensory modalities.
As in other lower vertebrates, zebrafish dHb exhibits prominent 
molecular (29, 30) and structural asymmetries (39). As expected, 
habenular lateralization has important consequences with respect 
to the segregation of different sensory modalities across habenular 
hemispheres and for regulating the targeting of habenular axons to 
different output regions (27, 33, 39). We observed that the functional 
lateralization of sensory inputs and computations in habenula is 
prominent mostly in the dHb, which develops early during devel-
opment (38), whereas we did not observe functional lateralization 
in vHb, which develops later (32), despite the prominent sensory-­
evoked vHb responses. This developmental order eventually leads 
to a decrease in functional lateralization across the entire habenula 
as the animals maturate. Similar to primary sensory systems (12), 
maturation of zebrafish habenula requires the early presence of 
sensory inputs (34). When these inputs are removed before a critical 
time window, zebrafish dHb loses its functional lateralization (34). 
It is also important to note that aversive stimuli (mechanical vibrations 
and mild electric stimulation) did not elicit lateralized responses in 
zebrafish habenula, which is in line with studies performed in the 
mammalian lateral habenula, where aversive responses showed no 
apparent lateralization (25, 26, 58). We suggest that the apparent 
lack of lateralization in the mammalian habenula is due to a continued 
maturation of lateral habenula dominated by aversive cue responses 
and reduced availability of sensory information during mammalian 
in utero development.
The activity-dependent maturation of neural circuits does not 
solely rely on sensory inputs but also includes endogenously gener-
ated spontaneous activity (11). In several brain regions, sponta-
neously generated activity is thought to play important roles in the 
maturation of synaptic connections, refining network topography 
(13, 14, 59) and entraining developing circuits (17). In our study, we 
observed that habenular networks exhibit spatially organized spon-
taneous activity already at early developmental stages. A recent 
transcriptomics study revealed a topographic organization of 
habenular neurons based on their distinct molecular features already 
in 10-day-old zebrafish larvae (30) and likely overlap with the 
spatially organized spontaneous activity studied here. Whether the 
spontaneous activity is needed for the proper development of 
distinct habenular clusters or habenular function, as in other brain 
regions (13), is yet to be investigated.
We also observed that temporal features of habenular sponta-
neous activity changed, leading to faster kinetics at older ages. The 
trend for faster kinetics of intrinsically generated activity across 
development was also observed in other higher brain regions, such 
as the hippocampus (16, 50). What may underlie the faster kinetics 
of spontaneous activity bursts in older ages? It is likely that multiple 
processes can modulate spontaneous habenular activity leading to 
the observed dynamical changes during development. One possibility 
is that early spontaneous activity might be driven by glia (20) or 
other support cells (21), which usually generate slow bursts of activity. 
It was previously shown that astrocytes can modulate the bursting 
activity in the rodent habenula (60), and astroglia activation in

zebrafish can excite nearby neurons (61). Alternatively, it is possible 
that as the habenula develops, synaptic connections between 
habenular neurons become more mature. Together with the in-
creased inhibition we observed in the habenula, by the addition of 
GABAergic connections, such mature synapses can support faster 
neural dynamics. Last, part of the habenular spontaneous activity 
might also be driven by the activation of the ancestral corticolimbic 
homologs in the zebrafish forebrain. For example, it was shown that 
habenula is strongly driven by inputs received from entopeduncular 
nucleus (24, 62), lateral hypothalamus (26), and cortex (58). Hence, 
it is likely that the homologs of these input regions are not yet fully 
developed and cannot drive habenular activity in young zebrafish 
larvae. A recent study showed that the zebrafish equivalent of amygdala 
(Dm) (63), driving both entopeduncular nucleus and lateral hypo-
thalamus (63), also develops during the late juvenile stage (64). 
Together, we suggest that all these processes jointly contribute to 
the habenular spontaneous activity.
Our results revealed that the developmental changes in the tem-
poral kinetics of habenular spontaneous activity are accompanied 
by the sequential addition of newborn neurons across development. 
More specifically, we found that the spatially confined locations of 
neuronal clusters that are born during distinct developmental stages 
follow a mediolateral arrangement. In this arrangement, youngest 
neurons are located closer to the neural progenitors of the habenula 
on the medial wall, while the oldest habenular neurons are located 
closer to the lateral wall. Similar sequential stacking of newly born 
neurons was also observed during forebrain development in both 
zebrafish (65, 66) and rodents (6, 67). Moreover, such a sequential 
order of neurogenesis contributes to different neural subtypes in 
the zebrafish hindbrain and spinal cord (8–10), as well as the rodent 
entorhinal cortex (5). Hence, it is possible that recently described 
populations of habenular neurons with distinct molecular identities 
(30) might be born during different developmental stages of the 
zebrafish habenula. The topographically organized molecular (30) 
and functional clusters (30, 35, 37) of habenular neurons represent 
the distinct subdomains or functional modules of habenula and are 
likely associated with different aspects of animal behavior. Our data 
revealed that at least two of the functional clusters within habenula 
are born at two different developmental stages, stay in spatially con-
fined locations, and exhibit different functional features. Therefore, 
we propose that the distinct functional clusters of habenular neu-
rons are born at different developmental time points. In turn, such 
a developmental order could contribute to an increased diversity of 
habenular neurons and expand habenular function across develop-
ment. These ideas are in line with several recent studies that suggest 
that complex and cognitively demanding behaviors arise later in 
development as animals maturate (1, 2, 33, 37). Our findings in 
habenula suggest that such expansion of animal behavior might be 
due to the incorporation of new functional modules at different 
developmental time points. In the future, it will be interesting to see 
whether such sequential addition of new neuronal modules with 
distinct functional properties is a feature that is not only unique to 
habenula but also preserved across the brain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Fish maintenance
The animal facilities and maintenance of zebrafish, Danio rerio, 
were approved by the Norwegian Food Safety Authority. Fish were 
kept in 3.5-liter tanks at a density of 15 to 20 fish per tank in a Techniplast 
Zebtech Multilinking system at 28°C (pH 7), 6.0 ppm O2, and 700 S, 
at a 14-hour light/10-hour dark cycle. Fish received a normal diet of 
dry food (Zebrafeed, Sparos) two times per day and Artemia nauplii 
once a day (Grade 0, Platinum Label, Argent Laboratories). Larvae 
were maintained in egg water (1.2 g of marine salt and 0.1% methylene 
blue in 20 liters of reverse osmosed water) from fertilization to 
3 dpf. From 3 to 6 dpf, larvae were kept in artificial fish water 
(AFW): 1.2 g of marine salt in 20 liters of RO water. Animals used 
for experiments at 21 dpf were transferred to 3.5-liter tanks in the 
zebrafish facility at 3 dpf.
For experiments, the following fish lines were used: Tg(elavl3:​
GCaMP6s) (41), Tg(gad1b:GFP) (42), Tg(vglut2a:dsRed) (22), Tg(Lhx2a:​
gap-YFP) (22), Et(−0.6hsp70l:Gal4-VP16) s1020t; UAS:nfsB-mCherry 
(44), and Tg(her4.1:GFP) (53). Experiments were performed on 
embryos of nacre [mitfa; (68)] background.
Confocal anatomical imaging
Before embedding, fish were anesthetized with 0.02% tricaine methane-
sulfonate (MS-222). Animals were then embedded in 1% (for 3 to 6 dpf) 
or 2% (for 21 dpf) low–melting point (LMP) agarose (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) in a recording chamber (FluoroDish, World Precision Instru-
ments) with AFW. Anatomical Z scans were acquired using a Zeiss 
Examiner Z1 confocal microscope with a 20× water immersion objective 
[Zeiss; numerical aperture (NA) of 1.0; Plan-Apochromat] at room 
temperature, using 4× to 10× average for each plane.
BrDU labeling, immunostaining, and imaging
Labeling of newborn neurons with BrdU was performed at 3.5, 5.5, 
7.5, 14.5, and 20.5 dpf in Tg(HuC:GFP) (69) fish outcrossed to wild-
type (AB) fish. Embryos (25 hours post-fertilization) were dechori-
onated by Proteinase K (0.1 mg/ml; catalog number 25530049) at 
room temperature and washed several times with 1× E3 medium. A 
stock of 10 mM BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number B5002) in 
1× E3 medium was prepared, aliquoted, and stored at −20°C until 
use. For each treatment, a final concentration of 500 M BrdU was 
applied to 3- and 5-dpf fish. For 7-, 14-, and 21-dpf fish, 2.5 mM 
BrdU was used. Treatments were all performed for 5 hours. Fish 
were kept in a dark incubator until 5 dpf and were transferred to the 
water system at 6 dpf. From this point on, a 14-hour light/10-hour 
dark cycle was maintained. At 22 dpf, fish were sacrificed and fixed in 
4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) to 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at +4°C 
overnight, washed with 0.8% Triton X-100 in 1× phosphate-buffered 
saline (PBS; PBSTx), dehydrated by a serial methanol gradient, and 
kept at −20°C until further use. For immunohistochemical staining, 
fish were rehydrated back to the aqueous phase (1× PBS). Brains 
were dissected out in cold 1× PBS and were incubated in precooled 
acetone for 10 min at −20°C. Brains were incubated in preheated 
2 mM HCl at 37°C for 12 min, cooled at room temperature for 
10 min, and washed with 0.8% PBSTx. Samples were incubated in Rat 
anti-BrdU immunoglobulin G (IgG; 1:200 Bio-Rad, catalog number 
MCA2060) monoclonal antibody overnight at +4°C. After serial washes 
in 0.8% PBSTx, the secondary antibody (Goat anti-rat Alexa 555; 
1:500 dilution; Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog numberA-21434) 
and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) at 1:3000 dilution were 
applied. Following an overnight incubation at +4°C, samples were 
washed for a total of 2 hours with 0.8% PBSTx.
To measure pERK/tERK ratio, fish were euthanized and fixed 
in cooled 4% PFA in 0.25% PBTx (0.25% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS)

overnight at 4°C. Samples were permeabilized in 0.50% Trypsin-­
EDTA on ice for 40 min and washed. The samples were then incu-
bated in the blocking solution [2% normal goat serum, 1% bovine 
serum albumin (BSA), and 1% DMSO in 0.25% PBTx] for 1 hour 
followed by incubation in primary antibody solution [1:500 anti-
body (Ab), 1% BSA, and 1% DMSO in 0.25% PBTx] overnight at 
4°C. Next, samples were washed and incubated with secondary 
antibody solution (1:1000 Ab, 1:1000 DAPI, 1% BSA, and 1% DMSO 
in 0.25% PBTx) overnight at 4°C. Last, samples were washed and 
placed in glycerol. pERK/tERK ratio of the median z-projection 
confocal images were calculated in ImageJ (Fiji). The pERK/tERK 
ratio is normalized by the maximum pERK/tERK ratio and adjusted 
for the habenular size using a custom-made script in MATLAB.
For phospho–histone 3 staining, larvae were fixed in 4% PFA for 
2 hours at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. Following washes 
in 0.3% Triton-X in PBS (0.3% PBSTx), fixed samples were perme-
abilized in 100% acetone at −20°C for 20 min and blocked in 0.3% 
PBSTx containing 0.1% BSA. Samples were incubated with the 
primary antibody (phospho–histone 3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 
#sc-8656-R; 1:500 dilution) overnight at +4°C, followed by serial washes 
in 0.3% PBSTx and incubation with the secondary antibody (goat 
anti-rabbit Alexa 488 plus, Thermo Fisher Scientific, #A-11034, 
1:1000 dilution) overnight at +4°C. Next, samples were incubated 
in DAPI (1:1000) for 2 hours, before serial washes in 0.3% PBSTx.
For preservation, samples were transferred to 80% glycerol in 1× 
PBS and were kept at +4°C in the dark. For imaging, labeled brains 
were mounted in 80% glycerol on a glass slide with a coverslip. 
Anatomical Z scans of habenula were acquired using a Zeiss Examin-
er Z1 confocal microscope with a 20× plan NA 0.8 objective, using 
2× to 10× average for each plane. Phospho–histone 3–positive cells 
were manually counted on confocal stack using the Cell Counter 
Plugin of Fiji/ImageJ.
In vivo two-photon calcium imaging and sensory stimulation
Two-photon calcium imaging was performed on 3-, 6-, and 21-dpf-
old Tg(elavl3:GCaMP6s) zebrafish. Before embedding, fish were 
anesthetized with cold AFW. Animals were then embedded in 1% 
(for 3 to 6 dpf) and 2% (for 21 dpf) LMP agarose (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) in a recording chamber (FluoroDish, World Precision 
Instruments). LMP agarose solidified for 20 min, and the section 
covering the nose was carefully removed to expose the nostrils. The 
animal was then placed under the microscope with constant perfu-
sion of AFW bubbled with carbogen (95% O2 and 5% CO2). First, 
spontaneous activity was measured for 30 min. Afterward, five 
repetitions of sensory stimuli (red light flash or food odor) were 
applied. The food odor stimulus was prepared by adding 1 g of 
standard dried fish food (Zebrafeed, Sparos; <100) in 50 ml of AFW, 
dissolved for 1 hour, filtered with a 22-m filter, and diluted 1:50 in 
AFW. For skin extract (70), an adult zebrafish was euthanized in 
ice-cold water and decapitated, and the skin was peeled off from 
the body, incubated in 1 ml of AFW, mixed, and centrifuged at 
1300 rpm and 4°C for 1 hour. One milliliter of the supernatant was 
then dissolved in 300 ml of AFW. Amino acid mixture (70) con-
tained arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, alanine, phenylalanine, 
histidine, and methionine, all diluted in AFW at 10−4 M final con-
centration. Ammonium chloride was diluted in AFW at 10−4 M 
final concentration. The odor stimulus was delivered for 5 s through 
a tube positioned in the front of the fish, connected to an Arduino 
Due–controlled high-performance liquid chromatography injection 
valve (Valco Instruments). Fluorescein (10−4 M) was dissolved in 
AFW and used to measure the precise onset of odor delivery to the 
nose at the end of each experiment. For the light stimulus, we used 
a red LED (LZ1-00R105, LedEngin; 625-nm wavelength) and placed 
it in the front of the recording chamber near the tube. The light 
stimulus was a flash of 2-s duration with an intensity of 0.318 mW. 
Mechanical vibrations were delivered via solenoid tapper (SparkFun 
Electronics, ROB-10391), via 50-ms application of 6 V. Mild electric 
stimulation was delivered by tungsten electrodes that passed 1-kHz 
oscillating current of 0.05 mA for a period of 1 s. The recordings 
were performed with a two-photon microscope (Scientifica) using a 
16× water immersion, long working-distance objective (Nikon, NA 
0.8, LWD 3.6). A mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser (MaiTai Spectra-­
Physics) tuned to 920 nm was used for excitation. Volumetric re-
cordings (eight planes with Piezo) were obtained at an acquisition 
rate of 31.9 Hz for a volume of 1536 × 512 pixels × 8 planes. Total 
duration of the recordings was 45 to 60 min.
Juvenile zebrafish electrophysiological recordings 
of habenular neurons
The experiments were conducted in a juvenile zebrafish brain explant 
preparation (61). Juvenile zebrafish were euthanized by immersion 
in ice-cold water, followed by decapitation to ensure death. The 
head was transferred in cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) 
bubbled with carbogen (95% O2/5% CO2). The ACSF (70) was 
composed of the following chemicals diluted in reverse-osmosis 
purified water: 131 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.25 mM KH2PO4, 2 mM 
MgSO4⋅7H2O, 10 mM glucose, 2.5 mM CaCl2, and 20 mM NaHCO3. 
The eyes, jaws, and ventral part of the skull were carefully removed 
using forceps, exposing the habenula. The brain explant was then 
affixed using tungsten pins to a small petri dish coated with Sylgard 
(World Precision Instruments) and perfused in constant flow 
bubbled ACSF.
We performed intracellular recordings of single habenular 
neurons, via borosilicate patch pipettes (10 to 12 megohms) mounted on 
a MultiClamp 700B amplifier. Electrodes contained the intracellular 
solution (130 mM k-gluconate, 10 mM Na-gluconate, 10 mM 
Hepes, 10 mM Na2+-phosphocreatine, 4 mM NaCl, 4 mM adenosine 
5′-triphosphate–Mg, and 0.3 mM Na3+-GTP) (70). Negative volt-
age steps (−30 mV) of 500 ms were applied to measure the input 
resistance.
In vivo birthdating of neurons
Before injections, 2.5-dpf larvae were dechorionated manually and 
anesthetized in 0.01% MS-222 in AFW for 5 to 10 min. Injections 
were done on larvae embedded in 1% LMP agarose in AFW and 0.01% 
MS-222 in AFW. The stock solution contained 5 mM CellTrace Far 
Red–AM or CellTrace CFSE Cell Proliferation Kit (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) dissolved in DMSO provided with the proliferation kit. 
The injection mixtures contained 0.5 l of this CellTrace Far Red/
DMSO stock solution dissolved in 2.5 l of ACSF with a final con-
centration of 1 mM. The ACSF contained the following: 124 mM 
NaCl, 22 mM d-(+)-glucose, 2.0 mM KCl, 1.6 mM MgSO4·7 H2O, 
1.3 mM KH2PO4, 24 mM NaHCO3, and 2.0 mM CaCl2·2H2O. The 
injection needles were pulled with a Sutter Instrument Co. Model 
P-2000, from thin-walled borosilicate capillaries (1.00 mm; VWR), 
with the following settings: heat = 785, filament = 4, velocity = 40, 
delay = 220, and pull = 70. The needle tip was cut open with forceps 
afterward, and a pressure injector (Eppendorf Femtojet 4i) was used

to inject 1 nl of solution in the telencephalic ventricle near habenula 
of either 2.5- or 5-day-old zebrafish larvae (55). The pressure and 
time used for the injection were calibrated for each needle using a 
0.01-mm calibration slide for microscopy. Usually, the pressure 
ranged between 100 and 150 hPa, and the time span of the pressure 
pulse lasted for 0.30 to 0.70 s. After injection, fish were released 
from agarose and recovered at 28°C AFW and transferred to the 
fish facility and raised until 12 or 21 days.
Fish (21 dpf) were prepared for confocal microscopy imaging as 
described above for two-photon calcium imaging. Imaging was 
performed using a Zeiss Examiner Z1 confocal microscope with a 
20× water immersion objective (Zeiss; NA of 1.0; Plan-Apochromat) 
at room temperature and constant perfusion of AFW bubbled with 
carbogen (95% O2 and 5% CO2). In vivo calcium recordings of the 
spontaneous activity in habenula were acquired at an acquisition 
rate of 1.918 Hz for 512 × 1024 pixels during 5 min.
Data analysis
Two-photon microscopy images were aligned using an adapted 
algorithm (71) that corrects for occasional drift in the XY dimension, 
based on “hierarchical model-based motion estimation” (72). Every 
recording was manually checked for motion, and corresponding 
frames were discarded from further analysis. Individual neurons 
were semiautomatically detected using a pattern recognition algo-
rithm as previously described (35, 61, 71). Once neurons were 
detected, their locations were individually tracked during the record-
ing. If any z-motion drift or if some detected neurons were no longer 
visible, those neurons were discarded from further analysis. The 
pixels belonging to each neuron were then averaged providing the 
complete time course of each neuron over time. The same cell-­
detection algorithms were used for the confocal recordings in Fig. 6. 
To distinguish between developmentally tagged and untagged neurons, 
we manually identified the red cells. To normalize the spontaneous 
activity for each cell to its baseline fluorescence, we calculated the 
fractional change in fluorescence (F/F) relative to the baseline, 
which was calculated as the eighth percentile of activity observed 
within a 2-min time window as previously described (51). Clustering 
of neurons was performed as previously reported on the basis of the 
k-means clustering algorithm in MATLAB, as well as the calcula-
tion of cluster fidelity and cluster selectivity for sensory and tagged 
cells (35).
Before event detection, traces from neurons in the two-photon 
recordings were resampled to a final rate of 2 Hz (using decimate 
function in MATLAB), to match the sampling rate with confocal 
experiments. Significant calcium events were detected using an 
algorithm (51) that detects calcium events significantly different from 
noise level within a 95% confidence interval. A cell was considered 
active if at least one event was detected in 4 min of ongoing activity. 
The amplitude of events was defined as the maximum peak in the 
event. The average activity per cell was defined as the sum of the 
area under the curve (using trapezoidal numerical integration 
method, function “trapz” in MATLAB) for all events within one 
neuron. The fractional change in fluorescence (F/F) for the odor 
and light stimulus, as well as mechanical vibrations and mild 
electric stimulus, was calculated by subtracting the average baseline 
fluorescence before stimulus onset (5 s) from the responsive window 
(10 s for odor and 2 s for light, mechanical vibrations, and mild 
electric stimulus from the onset of the stimulus). Cells were classified 
as responding if at least four out of five trials showed the same sign 
difference (+/−) locked to the stimulus onset. Only the positively 
responding neurons were taken into account for further analysis.
The focality index was calculated as 1 minus the average of the 
Euclidean distances between the top 10% neurons (with highest fre-
quencies or durations) divided by the average of the Euclidean distances 
of all neurons within each hemisphere. The average focality index per 
fish was calculated by taking the average over the two hemispheres. 
Same focality index was calculated for the sensory-­responding cells.
Cluster fidelity was calculated by measuring the probability of 
pairs of neurons being in the same cluster during two different time 
periods (35). As a control, we shuffled the cluster identity of neurons 
randomly.
To calculate cluster selectivity, we first calculated the cluster 
identity of each neuron using k-means clustering of spontaneous 
neural activity (35). Later, we identified neurons with a given prop-
erty, in this case, either sensory responding neurons (Fig. 4G) or 
developmentally tagged neurons (Fig. 6L), and measured the sparseness 
in the distribution of identified neurons into clusters (35). We then 
compared this to all and/or equal number of nonsensory responding 
neurons within each fish. If sparseness is 1, all identified neurons 
are selectively members of a single cluster; if sparseness is 0, all 
identified neurons are equally distributed into all functional clusters 
identified by k-means clustering.
The lateralization index was calculated as the difference between 
the percentage of responding neurons in the left and right hemispheres. 
If lateralization index is 1, neurons are lateralized to one hemisphere; if 
lateralization index is 0, neurons are equally distributed among hemispheres.
In the confocal microscopy functional imaging, results for frequency, 
duration, number of active neurons, average activity, and pairwise 
correlations are shown for all planes imaged in each fish. These 
recordings were done at different time points.
Quantification and statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was done using MATLAB, and P values are indicated 
in the figure legends (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001). Student 
t test was used for paired data, and unpaired t test was used when data 
were obtained from two independent datasets. For the data that 
displayed no Gaussian distribution, we used Wilcoxon signed-rank 
test for paired data and Wilcoxon rank sum test for unpaired data.
Data and software
All analysis was performed with Fiji and MATLAB as indicated 
in Results.
